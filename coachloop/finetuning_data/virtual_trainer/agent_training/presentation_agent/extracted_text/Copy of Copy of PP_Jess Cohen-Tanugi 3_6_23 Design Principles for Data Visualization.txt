BEST PRACTICES FOR DATA VISUALIZATION

Data visualization is an iterative process
5

Choose a message, and compose a visualization.
Your visualization is probably part 
of a narrative, and will have a 
message you can summarize in 
words. 
6
You can (and probably will) tell 
many different stories with the 
same data.

Just because you can map doesn’t mean you should

Missing/ambiguous data is not mappable

https://blog.datawrapper.de/guide-what-to-consider-when-creating-tables/
“Put some consideration into how your table is sorted. It’s tempting to just sort the first 
column alphabetically. But often, that approach won’t bring the most interesting data to the 
top. In which row does the most important value hide? Consider showing this one first.”

BASIC GRAPHIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Graphic design in visualization
Visual by the NYTimes.
A more complicated 
example here.

C.R.A.P. principles of graphic design
●Contrast: be bold in your differences
●Repetition: repeat visual elements to make visual themes
●Alignment: everything should align to something. Beware of centering.
●Proximity: related things should be closer together.
