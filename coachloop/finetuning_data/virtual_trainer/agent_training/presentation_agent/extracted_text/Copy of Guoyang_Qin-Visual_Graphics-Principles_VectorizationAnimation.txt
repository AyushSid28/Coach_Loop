#1 Contrast
Contrast is one of the most effective ways to add visual interest to your page—a striking interest that 
makes a reader want to look at the page—and to create an organizational hierarchy among different 
elements. 
Contrast is created when two elements are different. 
If the two elements are sort of different, but not really, then you don’t have contrast, you have conflict. 
If two items are not exactly the same, then make them different. Really different.

#2 Repetition 
Repeat some aspect of the design through out the entire piece. The repetitive element may be a bold 
font, a thick rule (line), a certain bullet, color, design element, particular format, the spatial 
relationships, etc. It can be anything that a reader will visually recognize.
Repetition can be thought of as “consistency.”
But repetition goes beyond just being naturally consistent—it is a conscious effort to unify all parts of 
a design.

#3 Alignment
Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every item should have a visual connection with 
some thing else on the page.” The principle of alignment forces you to be conscious—no longer can 
you just throw things on the page and see where they stick.
When items are aligned on the page, the result is a stronger cohesive unit. Even when aligned 
elements are physically separated from each other, there is an invisible line that connects them, both 
in your eye and in your mind.

#4 Proximity
Very often in the work of new designers, the words and phrases and graphics are strung out all over 
the place, filling corners and taking up lots of room so there won’t be any empty space. There seems 
to be a fear of empty space.
When pieces of a design are scattered all over, the page appears unorganized and the information 
may not be instantly accessible to the reader.
Group related items together, move them physically close to each other so the related items are seen 
as one cohesive group rather than a bunch of unrelated bits.

Summary
Contrast - If two items are not exactly the same, then make them different. Really different
Repetition - Repeat some aspect of the design through out the entire piece
Alignment - Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every item should have a visual 
connection with some thing else on the page.
Proximity - Group related items together

Vector graphics
Infinitely scalable
Raster graphics
Subject to resolutions
High-quality, professional, easy-to-reuse
Compatible, printing-friendly
Vectorization
PROS
CONS
Rendered slowly if complicated
Pixelated, less professional, hard-to-reuse
37

Scalable
Vector graphics are computer graphics images that are defined in terms of 2D points, which are connected 
by lines and curves to form polygons and other shapes. WIKIPEDIA
Matrix manipulations
Affine transformations
www.vecteezy.com/editor
However, raster images are just a matrix of colored pixels, cannot be recomputed when scaled.

Not just a static image any longer, it is a group of objects you can manipulate to tell great stories.
