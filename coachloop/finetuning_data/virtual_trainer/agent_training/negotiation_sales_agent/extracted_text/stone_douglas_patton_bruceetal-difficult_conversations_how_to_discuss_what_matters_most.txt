Sort Out the 
Three Conversations 
Jack is about to have a difficult conversation. 
He explains: "Late one afternoon I got a call from Michael, a 
good friend and occasional client. Tm in a tight spot,'. he told me. 'I 
need a financial brochure laid out and printed by tomorrow after-
noon.' He said his regular designer· was out and that he was under a 
lot of pressure. 
. 
"I was in the middle of another project, but Michael was a 
friend, so I dropped everything and worked late into the night on his 
brochure. 
"Early -the next morning Michael reviewed the mock-up and 
gave the go-ahead to have it printed. I had the copies on his desk by 
noon. I was exhausted, but I was glad I'd been able to help him out. 
"Then I got back to my office and discovered this voice-mail 
message from Michael: 
Well, you really screwed this one up! Look, Jack, I know you were 
under time pressure on this, but . 
[sigh]. The earnings chart isn't 
presented clearly enough, and it's slightly off. It's just a disaster. This 
is an important client. I assume you'll fix it right away. Give me a 
.call as soon as you get in. 
"Well, you can imagine how I .felt about that message. The chart 
was off, but microscopically. I called Michael right .away~,, 

4 
The Problem 
Their conversation went like this: 
JACK: Hi, Michael, I got your message -
MICHAEL: Yeah, look Jack, this thing has to be done over. 
JACK: Well, wait a second. I agree it's not perfect, but the chart is 
clearly labeled. Nobody's going to misunderstand -
MICHAEL: C'mon, Jack. You know as well as I do that we can't 
send this thing out like this. 
JACK: Well, I think that -
M1~HAEL: There's really n?thing to argue about here. Look, we 
all screw up. Just fix it and let's move on. 
JACK: Why didn't you say something about this when you looked 
at it this morning? 
MICHAEL: I'm not the one who's supposed to be proofreading. 
Jack, I'm under tremendous pressure to get this done and to 
get it done right. Either you're on the team or you're not. I 
need a yes or a no. Are you going to redo it? 
JACK: [pause] Alright, alright. I'll do it. 
This exchange has all the hallmarks of a difficult conversation 
going offthe rails. Months later, Jack still feels lousy about this con-
versation and. his relationship with Michael remains strained. He 
wonders what he could have done differently, and what he should do 
about it now. 
But before we get to that, let's look at what Jack and Michael's 
conversation can teach us about how difficult conversations work. 
Decodin·g the Structure 
of Difficult Conversations 
Surprisingly, despite what appear to be infinite variations, all difficult 
conyersations share .a common structure. When you're caught up in 
the details and anxiety of a particular difficult conversation, this 
structure is hard to see. But understanding that structure is essential 
to improving how you handle your most challenging conversations.

There's More Here Thon Meets the Ear 
In the conversation be"tween Jack and Michael recounted above, the 
words reveal only the surface of what is really going on. To make .the 
structure of a difficuJt conversation visible, we need to understand 
not only what is said, but also what is not said. We need to under-
stand what the people involved are thinking and feeling but not say-
ing to each other. In a difficult conversation, this is usually where the 
real action is. 
Look at what Jack is thinking and feeling, but not saying, as this 
conversation proceeds: 
What Jack Thought and 
Felt But Didn't Say 
How could he leave a message 
like that?! After I drop every-
thing, break a dimier date with 
my wife, and stay up all night, 
that's the thanks I get?! 
A total overreaction. Not even a 
CPA would be able to tell that 
-the graph is off. At the same 
time, I'm angry with myself for 
making such a stupid mistake. 
What Jack and Michael 
Actually Said 
JACK: Hi, Michael, I got your 
message -
MICHAEL: 'Yeah, look Jack, this 
thing has to be done over. 
JA<;:K: Well, wait a second. I 
agree it's not perfect, but the 
chart is clearly labeled. No-
body' s gomg to misunder-
stand -
MICHAEL: C'mon, Jack, you 
know as well as I do that we 
can't send this thing out like 
this.

What Jack Thought and 
Felt But Didn't Say 
Michael tries to· intimidate col-
leagues into getting his way. But 
he shouldn't treat me that way. 
I'm a friend! I want to stand up 
for myself, but I don't want to 
get into a big fight about this. I 
can't afford to lose Michael as a 
client or as a friend. I feel stuck. 
Screw up!? This isn't my fault. 
You approved it, remember? 
Is that how you see· me? As a 
proofreader? 
I'm sick of this whole thing. I'm 
going to be bigger than whatever 
pettiness is driving him. The 
best way out is for me just to be 
generous and redo it. 
The Problem 
What Jack and Michael 
A~tually Said 
JACK: Well, I think that -
MICHAEL: There's really noth-
mg to argue about here. 
Look, we all screw up. Just fix 
it and let's move on. 
JACK: Why didn't you say some-
thing about this when you 
looked at it this morning? 
MICHAEL: I'm not the one 
who's supposed to be proof-
reading. I'm under tremen-
dous pressure to get this done 
and to get it done right. Ei~ 
ther you're on the team or 
you're not. I need a yes or a 
no. Are you going to redo it? 
JACK: [pause] Alright, alright. 
I'll do it. 
Meanwhile, there's plenty that Michael is thinking and feeling 
but not saying. Michael is wondering whether he should have hired 
Jack in the first place. He hasn't been all that happy with Jack's work 
in the past, but he decided to go out on a limb with his partners to give 
his friend another chance. Michael is now frustrated with Jack and 
confused about whether hiring Jack was a good decision -
personally 
or professionally. 
The first insight, then, is a simple one: there's an awful lot going 
on between Jack and Michael that is not being spoken. 

Sort Out the Three Conversations 
7 
That's typical. In fact, the gap between what you're really think-
ing and what you're saying is part of what makes a conversation diffi-
cult. You're distracted -by all that's going on inside. You're uncertain 
about what's okay to share, and what's better left unsaid. And you 
know that just saying what you're thinking would probably not make 
the conversation any easier. 
Each Difficult Conversation Is Really Three Conversations 
In studying hundreds of conversations of every kind we have discov-
ered that there is an underlying structure to what's going on, and 
understanding this structure, in itself, is a powerful first step in im-
provi~g how we. deal with these conversations. It turns out that no 
matter what the subject, our thoughts and feelings fall into the same 
three categories, or "conversations." And in each of these conversa-
tions we ma_ke predictable errors that distort our thoughts and feel-
ings, and get us into trouble. 
Everything problematic that Michael and Jack say, think, and 
feel falls into one of these three "conversations." And everything in 
your difficult conversations does too. 
1. The "What Happened?" Conversation. Most difficult con-
versations involve disagreement about what has happened or what 
should happen. Who said what and 'fho did what? Who's right, who 
meant what, and who's to blame? Jack and Michael tussle over these 
issues, both out loud and internally. Does the chart need to be re-
done? Is Michael trying to intimidate Jack? Who should have caught 
the error? 
2. The Feelings Conversation. Every difficult conversation also 
asks and answers questions about fee.lings. Are my feelings valid? Ap-
propriate? Should I acknowledge or deny them, put .them on the ta-
ble or check them at the door?··What do I do about the other person's 
feelings? What if they are angry or hurt? Jack's and Michael's 
thoughts are littered with feelings. For .example, "This is the thanks I 

8 
The Problem 
get?!" signals hurt and anger, and 'Tm under tremendous pressure" 
reveals anxiety. These feelings are not addressed directly in the con-
versation, but they leak in anyway. 
3. The Identity Conversation. This is the conversation we each 
have with ourselves about what this situation means to us. We con-
duct an internal debate over whether this means we are competent 
or incompetent, a. good. person or bad, worthy of love or unlovable. 
What impact might it have on our self-image and self-esteem, our fu-
ture and our well-being? Our answers to these questions determine 
in large part whether we feel "balanced" during the conversation, or 
whether we feel off-center and anxious. In the conversation between 
Jack and Michael, Jack is struggling with the sense that he has been 
incompetent, which makes him feel less balanced. And Michael is· 
wondering whether he acted foolishly in hiring Jack\ 
Every difficult conversation involves grappling with these Three 
Conversations, so engaging successfully requires learning to operate 
effecHvely in each of the three realms. Managing all three simultane-
ously may seem hard, but it's easier than facing the consequences of 
engaging in difficult conversations blindly. 
What We Can't Change, and What We Con 
No matter how skilled we become, there are certain challenges in 
each of the Three Conversations that we can't -change. We will still 
run into situations where untangling "what happened" is more com-
plicated than we initially suspect. We will each have information the 
other person is unaware of, and raising each other's awareness is not 
easy. And we will still face emotionally charged situations that feel 
threatening because they put important aspects of our identity at risk. 
What we can change is the way we respond to each of these chal-
lenges. Typically, instead of exploring what information the other 
person might have that we don't, we assume we know all we need to 
know to understand and explain things. Instead of working to man-

Sort Out the Three Conversations 
9 
age our feelings constructively, we either try to hide them or let loose 
in ways that we later regret. Instead of exploring the identity issues 
that may be deeply at stake for us (or them), we proceed with the 
conversation as if it says nothing about us - and never come to grips 
with what is at the heart of our anxiety. 
By understanding these errors .and the havoc they wreak, we can 
begin to craft better approaches. Let's explore each conversation in 
more depth. 
The "What Happened?" Conversation: 
What's the Story Here? 
The "What Happened?" Conversation is where we spend much of 
our time in difficult conversations as we struggle with our different 
stories about who's right, who meant what, and who's to blame. On 
each of these three fronts - truth, intentions, .and blame - we make 
a common but crippling assumption. Straightening out each of these 
assumptions is essential to improving our ability to handle difficult 
conversations well. 
The Truth Assumption 
As we argue vociferously for our view, we often fail to question one 
crucial asspmption upon which our whole stance in the conversation 
is built: I am right, you are wrong. This simple assumption causes 
endless g~ief. 
What am I right about? I am right that you drive too fast. I am right 
that you are unabl~ to mentor younger colleagues. I am right that your 
comments at Thanksgiving were inappropriate. I am right that the 
patient should have received more medication after such a painful 
operation. I am right that the contractor overcharged me. I am right 
that I deserve a raise. I am right that the brochure is fine as it is. The 
number of things I am right about would fill a book. 

10 
The Problem 
There's only one hitch: I am not right. 
How could this be so? It seems impossible. Surely I must be right 
sometimes! 
Well, no. The point is this: difficult conversations are almost 
never about getting the facts right. They are about conflicting per-
ceptions, interpretations, and values. They are not about what a con-
• 
tract states, they are about what a contract means. They are not about 
which child-rearing book is most popular, they are about which 
child-rearing book we should f9'1low. 
They are not about what is true, they are about what is important. 
Let's come back to Jack and Michael. There is no dispute aboiit 
whether the graph is accurate or not. They both agree it is not. The 
dispute is over whether the error is worth worrying about and, if so, 
how to handle it. These are not questions of right and wrong, but 
questions of interpretation and judgment. Interpretations and judg-
ments are important to explore. In contrast, the quest to determine 
who is right and who is wrong .is a dead end. 
In the "What Happened?" Conversation, moving away from the 
truth assumption frees us to shift our purpose from proving we are 
right to understanding the perceptions, interpretations, and values of 
both sides. It allows us to move away from delivering messages and 
toward asking questions, exploring how each person. is making sense 
of the world. And to offer our views as perceptions, interpretations, 
and values -
not as "the truth.'
1 
The Intention Invention 
The second argument in the "What Happened?" Conversation is 
over intentions ~ yours and· mine. Did you yell at me to hurt my 
feeli_ngs or merely to emphasize your point? Did you throw my ciga-
rettes out because you're trying to control my behavior or because 
you want to help me live up to my commitment to quit? What I think 
about your intentions will affect how I think about you and, ulti-
mately, how our conversation goes. 

Sort Out the Three Conversations 
11 
The error we make in the realm of intentions is simple but pro-
found: we assume we know the intentions of others when we don't. 
Worse still, when we are unsure about someone's intentions, we too 
often decide they are bad. 
The truth is, intentions are invisible. We assume them from 
other people's behavior. In other words, we make them up, we invent 
them. But our invented stories about other people's intentions are ac-
curate much less often than we think. Why? Because people's inten-
tions, like so much else in difficult conversations, are complex. 
Sometimes people act with mixed intentions. Sometimes they act 
with no intention, or at least none. related to us. And sometimes they 
act on good intentions that nonetheless hurt us. 
Because our view of others' intentions (and their views of ours) 
are so important in difficult conversations, leaping to unfounded as-
sumptions can be a disaster. 
The Blame Frame 
The third error we make in the "What Happened?" Conversation 
has to do with blame. Most difficult conversations focus significant 
attention on who's to blame for the mess we're in. When the com-
pany loses its biggest client, for example, we know that there will 
shortly ensue a ruthless game of blame roulette. We don't care where 
the ball lands, as long as it doesn't land on us. Personal relationships 
are no different. Your relationship with your stepmother is strained? 
She's to blame. She should sto_p bugging you about your messy room 
and the kids you hang out with. 
In the conflict between Jack and Michael, Jack believes the 
problem is Michael's( fault: the time to declare your hypersensitivity 
to formatting is before the brochure goes to print, not after. And, 
of course; Michael believes. the problem is Jack's fault: Jack did the 
layout, mistakes are his responsibility. 
But talking about fault is similar to talking about truth - it 
produces disagreement, denial, and little leami~g. It evokes· fears 

12 
The Problem 
of punishment and insists on an either/or answer. Nobody wants 
to be blamed, especially unfairly, so our energy goes into defending 
ourselves. 
Parents of small children know this well. When the twins act up 
in the back seat of the car, we know that trying to affix blame will al-
ways yield an outcry: "But she hit me first!" or "I hit her because she 
called me a baby." Each child denies blame not just to avoid losing 
her dessert, but also from a sense of justice. Neither feels like the 
problem is solely her fault, because it isn't. 
From the front seat looking back, it is easy to see how each child 
has contributed to the fight. It's much more difficult to see how we've 
contributed to the problems in which we ourselves are involved. But 
in situations that give rise to difficult conversations, it is almost always 
true that whe:1t happened is the result of things both people did - or 
failed to do. And punishment is rarely relevant or appropriate. When 
competent, sensible people do something stupid, the smartest move 
is to try to figure out, first, what kept them from seeing it coming and, 
second, how to prevent the problem from happening again. 
Talking about blame distracts us from exploring why things went 
wrong and how·we might correct them going forward. Focusing in-
stead on understanding the contribution system allows us to learn 
about the real causes of the problem, and to work on correcting 
them. The distinction between blame and contribution may seem 
subtle. But it is a distinction worth working to understand, because it 
will make a significant difference in your ability to handle difficult 
conversations. 
The Feelings Conversation: 
What Should We Do with Our Emotions? 
Difficult conversations are not just about what happened; they also 
involve emotion. The question is not whether strong feelings will 
arise, but how to handle them. when they do. Should you tell your 
boss how you really feel about his management style, or about the 

Sort Out the Three Conversations 
13 
colleague who stole your idea? Should you share with your sister how 
hurt you feel. that she stayed friends with your ex? And what should 
you do with the anger you are likely to experi~nce if you decide to 
talk with that vendor about his sexist remarks? 
In the presence of strong feelings, many of us work hard to stay 
rational. Getting too deep into feelings is messy, clouds good judg-
ment, and in some contexts - for example, at work - can seem just 
plain inappropriate. Bringing up feelings can also be scary or uncom-
fortable, and can make us feel vulnerable. After all, what if th~ other 
person dismisses our feelings or responds without real understand-
ing? Or takes our feelings to heart in a way that wounds them or ir-
revocably damages the relationship? And once we've gotten our 
feelings off our chest, it's their tum. Are we up to hearing all about 
their anger and pain? 
This line of reasoning suggests that we stay out of the Feelings 
Conversation altogether - that Jack is better off not sharing his feel-
ings of a·nger and hurt, or Michael his sense of disappointment. 
Better to stick to questions about the brochure. Better to stick to 
"b . 
" 
us mess. 
Or is it? 
An Opera' Without Music 
The problem with this reasoning is that it fails to take account of one 
simple fact: difficult conversations do not just involve feelings, they 
are at their very core about feelings. Feelings are not some noisy 
byproduct of engaging in difficult talk, they are an integral part of the 
conflict. Engaging in a dif6cult conversation without talking about 
feelings is like staging-an opera without the music. You'll get the plot 
but mis~ the. point. In the conversation between Jack and Michael, 
for example, Jack never explicitly says that he feels mistreated or un-
derappreciated, yet months later Jack can still s~mmon his anger and 
resentment toward Michael. 
Consider some of your own difficult conversations. What feel-

14 
The Problem 
ings are involved? Hurt or anger? Disappointment, shame, confu-
sion? Do you feel treated unfairly or without respect? For some of us, 
even saying "I love you" or "I'm proud of you" can feel risky. 
In the short term, engaging .in a difficult conversation without 
talking about feelings may save you time and reduce your anxiety. It 
may also seem like a way to avoid certain serious risks - to you, to 
others, and to the relationship. But the question remains: if feelings 
are the issue, what have you accomplished if you don't address them? 
Understanding feelings, talking about feelings, managing 
feelings - these are among the greatest challenges_ of being human. 
There is nothing that will make dealing with feelings easy and risk-
free. Most of us, however, can do a better job in the Feelings Conver-
sation than we are now. It may not seem like it, but talking about 
feelings is a skill that can be learned. 
Of course, it doesn't always make sense to discuss feelings. As the 
saying goes, sometimes you should let sleeping dogs lie. Unfortu-
nately, a lack of skill in discussing feelings may cause you to avoid not 
only sleeping dogs, but all dogs - even 'those that won't let you sleep. 
The Identity Conversation: 
What Does This Say About Me? 
Of the Three Conversations, the Identity Conversation may be the 
most subtle and the most challenging. But it offers us significant 
leverage in managing our anxiety and improving our skills in the 
other two conversations. 
The Identity Conversation looks inward: it's all about who we are 
and how we see ourselves. How does what happened affect my self-
esteem, my self-image, my sense of who I am in the world? What im-
pact will it have on my future? What self-doubts do I harbor? In 
short: before, during, and after the difficult conversation, the Identity 
Conversation is about what I am saying to myself about me. 
You might think, 'Tm just trying to ask my boss for a raise. Why 
does my sense of who I am in the world matter here?" Or Jack might 
be thinking, "This is about the brochure, not about me." In fact, any-

Sort Out the Three Conversations 
15 
time a conversation feels difficult, it is in part precisely because it is 
about You, with a capital Y. Something beyond the apparent sub-
stance of the conversation is at stake for you. 
It may be something simple. What does it say about you when 
you talk to your neighbors about their dog? It may be that growing up 
in a small town gave you a strong self-image as a friendly person and 
good neighbor, so you are uncomfortable with the possibility that 
your neighbors might see you as aggressive or as~ troublemaker. 
Asking for a raise? What if you get turned down? In fact, what if 
your boss gives you good reasons for turning you down? What will 
that do to your self-image as a competent and respected employee? 
Ostensibly the subject is money, but what's really making you sweat 
is that your self-image is on the line. 
Even when you are the one delivering bad news, the Identity 
Conversation is in play. Imagine, for example, that you have to turn 
down an attractive new project proposal from Creative. The prospect 
of telling the people involved makes you anxious, even if you aren't 
responsible for the decision. In part, it's because you fear .how the 
conversation will make you feel about yourself: ''I'm not the kind of 
person who lets people down and crushes enthusiasm.Tm the person 
people respect for finding a way to do it, not for shutting the door." 
Your self-image as a person who helps others get things done butts up 
against the reality that you are going to be saying no. If you're no 
longer the hero, will people see you as the villain? 
Keeping Your Balance 
As you begin to sense the implications of the conversation for your 
self-image, you may begin to lose your balance. The eager young head 
of Creative, who reminds you so much of yoµrself at that age, looks 
disbelieving and betrayed. You suddenly feel confused; your anxiety 
skyrockets. You wonder whether it really makes sense to drop the idea 
so early in the process. Before you know it, you stammer out some-
thing about the possibility that the rejection will be reconsidered, 
et/en though you have absolutely no reason to believe that's likely. 

16 
The Problem 
In its mildest form, losing our balance may cause us to lose confi-
den~e .in ourselves, to lose concentration, or to forget what we were 
going to say. In more extreme cases, it can feel earth-shattering. We 
may feel paralyzed, overcome by panic, stricken with an urge to flee, 
or even have trouble breathing. 
Just knowing that the Identity Conversation is a component of 
difficult conversations can help. And, as in the other two conversa-
tions, you can do much better than mere awareness. While losing 
your balance sometimes is inevitable, the Identity Conversation 
need not cause as much anxiety as it does. Like dealing with feelings, 
grappling with the Identity Conversation gets easier with the devel-
opment of certain skills. Indeed, once you find your footing in the 
Identity Conversation, you can turn what is often a source of anxiety 
into a source of strength. 
-
Moving Toward a Learning Conversation 
Despite what we sometimes pretend, our initial purpose for having a 
difficult conversation is -often to p_rove a point, to give them a piece of 
our mind, or to get them to do or be what we want. In other words, to 
deliver a message. 
Once you understand the challenges inherent in the Three Con-
versations and the mistakes we make in each, you are likely to find 
that you~ purpose for having a particular conversation begins to shift. 
You come to appreciate the complexity of the perceptions and inten-
tions involved, the reality of joint contribution to the problem, the 
central role feelings have to play, and what the issues mean to each 
person's self-esteem and identity. And _you find that a message deliv-
ery stance no longer makes sense. In fact~ you may find that you no 
longer have a message to deliver, but rather some information to 
share and some questions to ask. 
Instead of wanting to persuade and get your way, you want to 
understand what has happened from the other person's point of view, 
explain your point of view, share and understand feelings, and work 
together to figure out a way to manage the problem going forward. In 

Sort Out the Three Conversations 
17 
so doing, you make_ it more likely that the other person will be open 
to being persuaded, and that you will learn something that signifi-
cantly changes the way you understand the problem. 
Chan·ging our stance means inviting the other person into the 
conversation with us, to help us figure things out. If we're going to 
achieve our purposes, we have lots we need to learn from them and 
lots they need to'learn from us. We need to have a learning conversa-
tion. 
The differences between a typical battle of messages and a learn-
ing conversation are summarized in the chart on the following pages.

This book will help you turn. difficult conversations into learning 
conversations by helping you handle each of the Three Conversa-
tions more productively and improving your ability to handle all 
three at once. 
The next five chapters explore in depth the mistakes. people com-
monly make in each of the Three Conversations. This will help you 
shift to a learning stance when it's your difficult conversation and you

aren't feeling very open. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 investigate the three as-
sumptions in the "What Happened?" Conversation. Chapter 5 shifts 
to the Feelings Conversation, and Chapter 6 takes up the Identity 
Conversation. These chapters will help you sort out your thoughts 
and feelings. This preparation is essential before you step into any 
difficult conversation. 
In the final six chapters we turn to the conversation itself, begin-
ning with when to raise an issue and when to let go, and if you're 
going to raise it, what you can hope to achieve and what you can't -
what purposes make sense. Then we turn to the mechanics of how to 
talk productively about the issues that matter to you: finding the best 
ways to begin, inquiring and listening to learn, expressing yourself 
with power and cladty, and solving problems jointly, including how 
to get the conversation back on track when the going gets rough. Fi-
nally, we return to how Jack might ·have a follow-up conversation 
with Michael to illustrate how this all might look in practice.

The "What Happened?" Conversation 
fn~strated, hurt, or misunderstood. And often the disagreement con-
tinues into the future, ~reaking havoc whenever it raises its head. 
When disagreement occurs, arguing may seem natural, even rea-
sonable. But it's not helpful. 
Why We\Argue, and Why It Doesn't Help 
Think about your own difficult conversations .in which there are 
important disagreements over what is really going on or what should 
be done. What's your explanation for what's causing the problem? 
We Think They Are the Problem 
In a charitable mood~ you may think, "Well, everyone has their opin-
ion," or, "There are two sides to every story." But most of us don't 
really buy that. Deep down, we believe that the problem, put simply, 
is them. 
• They're selfish. "My girlfriend won't go to a couples' counselor 
with me .. She says it's a waste of money. I say it's important to me, 
but she doesn't care." 
• They're naive. "My daughter's got these big ideas about going to 
New York and 'making it' in the theater. She just doesn't under-
stand what she's up against." 
• They're controlling. "We always do everything my boss's way. It 
drives me crazy, because he acts like his ideas are better than 
anyone else's, even when he doesn't know' what he'.s talking 
about." 
• They're irrational. "My Great Aunt Bertha sleeps on this sagging 
old mattress. She's got terrible back problems, but no matter 
what I say, she refuses to let me buy her a new mattress. Everyone

iq the family tells me, 'Rory, Aunt Bertha is just crazy. You can't 
reason with her! I guess it's true." 
If this is what we're thinking, then it's not surprising that we end 
up arguing. Rory, for example, cares about her Aunt Bertha. She 
wants to help, and she has the capacity to help. So Rory does what we 
all do: If the other person is stubborn, we assert harder in an attempt 
to break through whatever is keeping· them from seeing what is sensi-
ble. ("If you would just try a new mattress, you'd see how much more 
comfortable it is!") 
If the other person is naive, we try to educate them about how 
life really is, and if they are being selfish or manipulative, we may try 
to be forthright and call them on it. We persist in the hope that what 
we say will eventually make a difference. 
But instead, our persistence leads to arguments. And these argu-
ments lead nowhere. Nothing gets settled. We each feel unheard or 
poorly treated. We're frustrated not only because the other pers'on is 
being so unreasonable, but also because we feel powerl~ss to do any-
thing about it. .And the constant arguing isn't doing the relationship 
any good. 
Yet we're not sure what to do instead. We can't just pretend there 
is no disagreement, that .it doesn't matter, or that it's all the same to 
us. It does matter, ifs not all the same to us. That's why we feel so 
strongly about it in the first place. But if arguing leads us nowhere, 
what else can we do? 
The first thing-we should do is hear from Aunt Bertha. 
They Think We Are the Problem 
Aunt Bertha would be the first to agree that her mattress is indeed old 
and battered. "It's the one I shared with my husband for forty years, 
and it makes me feel safe," she says. "There are so many other 
changes in my life, it's nice to have a little haven that stays the same." 
Keeping it also provides Bertha with a sense of control over her life. 
When she complains, it's not because she wants answers, it's because 

28 
The "What ·Happened?" Conversation 
she likes the connection she feels when she keeps people current on 
her daily comings and goings. 
About Rory, Aunt Bertha has this to say: "I love her, but Rory can 
be a difficult person. She doesn't listen or care much about what 
other people think, and when I tell her that, she gets very angry and 
unpleasant." Rory thinks the problem is Aunt Bertha. Aunt Bertha, it 
seems, thinks the problem is Rory. 
This raises an inter.esting question: Why is it always the other per-
son who is naive or selfish or irrational or controlling? Why is it that 
we never think we are the problem? If you are having a difficult con-
versation, and someone asks why you disagree, how come you never 
say, "Because what I'm saying makes absolutely no sense"? 
We Each Make Sense in Our Story of What Happened 
We don't see ourselves as the problem because, in fact, we aren't. 
What we are saying does make sense. What's qften hard to see is that 
what the other person is saying als[! makes sense. Like Rory and Aunt 
Bertha, we each have different stories al?out what is going on in the 
world. ,In Rory's story, Rory's thoughts and actions are iperfectly sensi-
ble. In Aunt Bertha's story, Aunt Bertha's thoughts and actions are 
equally sensible. But Rory is not just a character in her own story, she 
is also a visiting character in Aunt Bertha's story. And in Aunt Bertha's 
story, what Rory says seems pushy and insensitive. In Rory's story, 
what Aunt Bertha says sounds irrational. 
In the normal course of things, we don't notice the ways in 
which our .story of the world is different from other people's. But dif-
ficult conversations arise at precisely those points where important 
parts of our story collide with another person's story. We .assume the 
collision is because of how the other person is; they assume it's 
because of how we are. But. really the collision is a result of our 
stories simply being different, with neither of us realizing it. It's as if 
Princess Leia were trying to talk to Huck Finn. No wonder we end 
up argumg.

Arg~ing Blocks Us fromJxploring Each Other's .Stories 
But arguing is not only a result of our failure to see that we and the 
other person are in different stories - it is also part of the cause. Ar-
guing inhibits our ability to learn how the other person sees the 
world. Wh_en we argue, we tend to trade conclusions - the "bottom 
line" of what we think: "Get a new mattress" versus "Stop trying to 
control me." 'Tm going to New York to make it big" versus "You're 
naive.'; "Couples counseling is helpful" versus "Couples counseling 
is a waste of time." 
But neither conclusion makes sense in the other person's -story. 
So we each dismiss the other's argument. Rather than helping us 
understand our different views, arguing results in a battle of mes-
sages. Rather than drawing us together, arguing pulls us apart. 
Arguing Without Understanding Is Unpersuasive 
t 
Arguing creates another problem in difficult conversations: it inhibits 
change. Telling someone to change makes it less rather than more 
likely that they will. This is because people almost never change 
without first feeli~g understood. 
Consider Trevor's conversation with Karen. Trevor is the finan-
cial administrator for the state Department of Social Services. Karen 
is a social worker with the department. "I cannot get Karen to tum irt 
her paperwork on time," explains Trevor. "I've told her over and over 
that she's missing the deadlines, but it doesn't help: And when I 
bring it up, she gets annoyed." 
~ 
Of course we know there~s another side to this story. U nfor-
tunately, Trevor doesn't know what it is. Trevor is telling Karen 
what she is supposed to do, but has not yet engaged her in a two-
way conversation about the issue. When. Trevor shifts his purposes 
from trying to change Kar.en's behavior·- arguing why being lat~ is 
wrong - to trying first to understand Karen, and then to be under-
stood by her, the situation improves dramatic.ally: 

30 
The "What Happened?" Conversation 
Karen described how overwhelmed and overworked she is. She puts 
all· of her energy into her clients, who are very needy. She was feel-
ing like I didn't appreciate that, which actually, I really didn't. On 
my end, l explained to her how I have to go through all kinds of ex-
tra work when she submits her paperwork late, and I explained the 
extra work in detail to her. She felt badly about that, and it was clear 
that she just hadn't thought about it from my perspective. She 
promised to put a higher priority on getting her work in on time, 
and so far she has. 
Finally, each has learned something, and the stage for meaning-
ful change is set. 
To get anywhere in a disagreement, we need to understand the 
other person's story well enough to see how their conclusions make 
sense within it. And we need to help them understand the story in 
which our conclusions make sense. Understanding each other's sto-
ries from the inside won't necessarily "solve" the problem, but as 
with Karen and Trevor, it's an essential first step. 
Different Stories:. 
Why We Each See the World Differently 
As we move away from arguing and toward trying to understand the 
other person's story, it .helps to know why people have different stories 
in the first place. Our stories 
don't come out of nowhere. 
They aren~t random. Our sto-
ries are built in often uncon-
scious ·but systematic ways. 
First, we take in information. 
We experience the world -
sights, sounds, and feelings. 
Second, we interpret what we 
see, hear, and feel; we give it

conclusions about what's happening. And at each step, there is an op-
portunity for different people's stories to diverge. 
Put simply, we all have different stories about the world because 
we each take in different information and then interpret this infor-
mation in our own unique ways. 
In difficult conversations, too often we trade only conclusions 
back and forth, without stepping down to where most of the real ac-
tion is: the information and interpretations that lead each of us to see 
the world as we,do. 
l. We Have Different Information 
There are two reasons we all have different information about the 
world. First, as each of us proceeds through life - and through any 
difficult situation - the information available to us is overwhelming. 
We simply can't take in all of the sights, sounds~ facts, and feelings in-
volved in even a single encounter. Inevitably, ~e end up noticing 
some things and ignoring others. And what we each choose to notice 
and ignore will be different. Second, we each have access to different 
information. 
We Notice Different Things. Doug took his four-year-old 
nephew, Andrew, to watch a homecoming parade. Sitting on his un-
cle's shoulders, Andrew shouted with delight as football players, 
cheerleaders, and the school band rolled by on lavish floats. After-
ward Andrew exclaimed, "That was the best truck parade I've ever 
seen!" 
Each float, it seems, was pulled by a truck. Andrew, truck ob-
sessed as he was, saw nothing else. His Uncle Doug, truck indiffer-
ent, hadn't noticed a single truck. In a sense, Andrew and his uncle 
watch_ed completely different parades. 
Like Doug and Andrew, what we notice has to do with. who we 
are and what we care about. Some of us pay mo.re attention to feel-
ings and relationships. Others to status and power, or to facts and 

32 
The "What Happened?" Conversation 
logic. Some of us are artists, others are scientists, others pragmatists. 
Some of us want to prove we're right; others want to avoid conflict or 
smooth it over. Some of us tend to see ourselves as victims, others as 
heroes, observers, or survivors. The information we attend to varies 
accordingly. 
Of course, neither Doug nor Andrew walked away from the pa-
rade thinking, "I enjoyed my particular perspective on the parade 
based on the information I paid attention to.'" Each walked away 
thinking, "I enjoyed the parade." Each assumes that what he paid at-
tention to was what was significant about the experience. Each as-
sumes he has "the facts." 
In a more serious setting, Randy and Daniel, coworkers on an 
assembly line, experience the sarrie dynamic. They've had a. number 
of tense conversations about racial i$SUes. Randy, who is white, be-
lieves that the company they work for has a gene'rally good record on 
minority recruitment and promotion. He notices that o( the seven 
people on his assembly team, two are African Americans and one is 
Latino, and that the head of the union is Latino. He has also learned 
that his supervisor is originally from the Philippines. Randy believes 
in the merits of a diverse workplace and has noticed approvingly that 
several people of color have recently been promoted. 
Daniel, who is Korean American, has a different view. He has 
been on the receiving end of unusual questions about his qualifica-
tions. He has experienced several racial slurs from coworkers arid one 
from a foreman. These experiences are prominent it;1 his mind. He 
also knows of several minority coworkers who were overlooked for 
promotion, and notices that a disproportionate number of the top ex-
ecutives at the company are white. And Daniel has listened repeat-
edly to executives who talk as if the only two racial categories that 
mattered were white and African American. 
While Randy and Daniel have some information that is shared, 
they have quite a bit of information that's not. Yet each assumes that 
the facts are plain, and his view is reality. In an important sense, it's 
as if J{andy and Daniel work at different companies. 
,, 
Often we go 'through an entire conversation - or indeed an en-
tire relationship - without ever realizing that each of us is paying at-

tention to different things, that our views are based on different infor-
mation. 
We Each Know Ourselves Better Than Anyone Else Can. In 
addition to choosing different information, we each have ,access to dif-
ferent information. For example, others have access to information 
about themselves that we don't. They know the constraints they are 
under; we don't. They know their hopes, dreams, and fears; we don't. 
We act as if we've got access to all the important information there is 
to know about them, but we don't. Their internal experience is far 
more complex than we imagine. 
. 
Let's return to the example of.Jack and Michael. When Michael 
describes what happened, he doesn't mention anything about Jack's 
staying up all night. He might not know that Jack stayed up all nighf, 
and even if he does, his "kno~ledge" would be quite limited com-
pared to what Jack knows about it. Jack was there. Jack knows what it 
felt like as he struggled to stay awake. He knows how uncomfortable 
it was when the heat was turned off at midnight. He knows how angry 
his wife was that he had to cancel their dinner to~ether. He knows 
about the anxiety he felt putting aside other important work to do 
Michael's project. Jack also knows how,happy he felt to be doing a fa-
vor for a friend. 
And there is plenty that Jack is not aware of. Jack doesn't know 
that Mich~el's client blew up just that morning over the choice of 
photograph in another brochure Michael had prepared. Jack doesri't 
know that the revenue figures are a particularly hot topic because of 
questions about some of the client's recent .business qecisions. Jack 
doesn't know that Michael's graphic designer has taken an unsched-
uled personal leave in the midst of their busiest season, affecting not 
just this project but others as well. Jack doesn't know that Michael ' 
has been dissatisfied with some of Jack's work in the past. And Jack 
doesn't know how happy Michael felt to be doing a favor for a friend. 
Of course, in advance, we don't know what we don't know. But 
rather than assuming we already know everything we need to, we 
should assume that there is important information we .don't have ac-
cess to. It's a good bet to be true. 

34 
The "What Happened?" Conversation 
2. We Hove Diffe_rent Interpretations 
"We never have sex," Alvie Singer complains in the movie Annie 
Hall. "We're constantly having sex," says his girlfriend. "How often 
do you have sex?" asks their therapist. "Three times a week[" they re-
ply in unison. 
A second reason we tell different stories about the world is 
that, even when we have the same information, we interpret it 
differently - we give it different meaning. I see the cup as half 
empty; you see it as a metaphor for the fragility of humankind. I'm 
thirsty; you're a poet. Two especially important factors in how we in-
terpret what we ;see are ( 1) our past experiences and (2) the implicit 
rules we've learned about how things should and should not be done. 
We Are Influenced by Past Experiences. The past gives mean-
ing to the present. Often, it is only in the context of someone's past 
experienee that we can understand why what they are saying or doing 
makes any kind of sense. 
To celebrate the end of a long project, Bonnie and her co-
workers scraped together the money to treat their supervisor, Caro-
line, to dinner at a nice restaurant. Throughout the .meal, Caroline 
did little but complain: "Everything is overpriced," "How can they 
get away with this?" and "You've got to be kidding. Five dollars for 
dessert!" Bonnie went home embarrassed and frustrated, thinking, 
"We knew she was cheap, but this is ridiculous. We paid so she 
wouldn't have to worry about the money, and still she complained 
about the cost. She ruined the evening." 
Though the story in Bonnie's head was that Caroline was simply 
a cheapskate or wet blanket, Bonnie eventually decided to ask Caro-
line why she had such a strong reaction to the expense of eating out. 
Upon reflection, Caroline explained: 
I suppose it has to do with growing up during the Depression. I can 
-still hear my mother's voice from when I was little, getting ready to

The "What Happened?" Conversation 
Thel111a and Ollie both interpret the situation through the lens of 
their own implicit rule, they each see the other person as acting 
inappropriately. 
Our implicit rules often take the form of things people "should" 
or "shouldn't" do: "You should spend money on education, but 
not on clothes." "You should never criticize a colleague in front of 
others." "You should never leave the toilet seat up, squeeze the tooth-
paste in the middle, or let the .kids watch more than two hours of 
lV." The list is endless. 
There's nothing wrong with having these rules. In fact, we need 
them to order our· lives. But when you find yourself in conflict, it 
helps to make your rules explicit and to encourage the other person 
to do the same. This greatly reduces the· chance that you will be 
caught in an accidental ·duel of conflicting rules. 
3. Our Conclusions Reflect Self-lnte.rest 
Finally, when we think about why we each tell our own stories about 
the world, there is no getting around the fact that our conclusions are 
partisan, that they often reflect our self-interest. We look for informa-
tion to support our view and give that information the most favorable 
interpretation. Then we .feel even more certain that our view is right. 
Professor Howard Raiffa of the Harvard Business School demon-
strated this phenomenon when he gave teams of people a set of facts 
about a company. He told some of the teams they would be negotiat-
ing to buy the company, and others that they would be selling the 
company. He then asked each team to value the company as objec-
tively as possible ( not the price at which they would offer to buy or 
·sell, but what they believed it was actually worth). Raiffa found· that 
sellers, in their heart of hearts, believed the company to be worth on 
average 30 percent more than the independently assessed fair market 
value. Buyers, in turn, valued it at 30 percent less. 
Each team -developed a self-serving perception without realizing 
they were doing so. They focused more on things that were consis-
tent with what they wanted to believe and tended to ignore, explain

The "What Happened?" Conversation 
The story Tony tells is different from what Keiko had imagined. 
From the outside, Tony is watching a game on 1V. But to Tony it's a 
matter of his mental health. Throughout the week, he works ten 
hours a day under extremely stressful conditions, then comes home 
and plays with his two boys, doing whatever they want. After the 
struggle of getting them to bed, he spends time with Keiko, talking 
mostly about her day. Finally, he collapses into bed. For Tony, watch-
ing the game is the one time during the week when he can truly re-
lax. His stress level goes down, almost as if he's meditating, and this 
three hours to himself has a significant impact on his ability to take 
on the week ahead. Since Tony believes that his sister won't care 
whether he comes today or tomorrow, he chooses in favor of his men-
tal health. 
Of course, that's not the end of the issue. Keiko needs to share 
her story with Tony, and then, once everything is on the table, to-
gether they can figure out what to do. But that will never happen if 
Keiko simply assumes she knows Tony's story, no matter how certain 
she is at the outset that she does. 
What's Your St.ory? 
One way to shift your stance from the easy certainty of feeling that 
you've thought about this from every possible angle is to get curious 
about what you don't know about yourself This may sound like an 
odd thing to worry about. After all, you're with yourself all the time; 
wouldn't you be pretty familiar with your own perspective? 
In a word, no. The proces~ by which we construct our stories 
about the world often happens so fast, and so automatically, that ·we 
are not even aware of all that influences.our views. For example, when 
we saw what Jack was really thinking and feeling_ during his conversa-
tion with Michael, there was nothing about the heat being turned off, 
or about his wife's anger at canceling their dinner plans. Even Jack 
wasn't fully aware of all the information behind his reactions. 
And what implicit rules are important to him? Jack thinks to 
himself, "I ca·n't believe the way Michael treated me/' but he is un-

The "What Happened?" Conversation 
talk. It can be heard as "Pretend both of your stories are right." But in 
fact, it suggests so~ething quite different. Don't pretend anything. 
Don't worry about accepting or rejecting the other person's story. 
First work to understand it. The mere act of understanding someone 
else's story doesn't require you to give up your own. The And Stance 
allows you to recognize that how you each see things matters, that 
how you each feel matters. Regardless of what you end up doing, re-
gardless of whether your story influences theirs or theirs yours, both 
stories matter. 
The And Stance is based on the assumption that the world is 
complex, that you can feel hurt, angry, and wronged, and they can 
feel just as hurt, angry, and wronged. They can be doing their best, 
and you can think that it's not good enough. You may have done 
something stupid, and they will have contributed in important ways 
to the problem as well. You can feel furious with them, and you can 
also feel love and appreciation for them. 
The And Stance gives you a place from which to _assert the full 
strength of your views and feelings without having to diminish the 
views and feelings of someone else. Likewise, you don't need to give 
up anything to hear how soll}eone else feels or sees things differently. 
Because you may have different information or different interpreta-
tions, both stories can make sense at the same time. 
It may be that as you share them, your stories change in response 
to new information or different perspectives. But they still may· not 
end up the same, and that's all right. Sometimes people have honest 
disagreements, but even so, the most useful question is not "Who's 
r.ight?" but "Now that we really understand each other, what's a good 
way to manage this problem?" 
Two Exceptions That Aren't 
You may be thinking that the advice to shift from certainty anc;l argu-
ing to curiosity and the And Stance generaJly makes sense, but that 
there must be exceptions. Let's look at two important questions that

The "What Happened?" Conversation 
marriage. But even if the whole world agrees with yo~r assessment, 
asserting that you are right and trying to get him to admit it probably 
won't help you help your friend. 
What may help is to tell him about the impact his drinking has 
on you, and, further, to try to understand his story. What is keeping 
him in denial? What would it mean to him to admit he has a prob-
lem? What gets in the way? Until you understand his story, and share 
yours with him, you can't help him find a way to rewrite the next 
chapter for the better. In this case, you may be right and your friend 
may be wrong, but merely being right doesn't do you much good. 
Giving Bad News 
What if you have to fire someone, end a relationship, or let a supplier 
know you're cutting bac~ on orders by 80 percent? In many difficult 
conversations, you don't have the power to impose an outcome uni-
laterally. When firing someone or breaking up or reducing ·orders, 
you do. In such situations, it's reasonable to wonder whether the 
other persqn' s story is still relevant. 
Most of the difficulty in firing someone or in breaiing up takes 
place in the Feelings and Identity Conversations, which we'll explore 
later. But the question of differing perspectives is also important. 
Remember, understanding the other person's story doesn't mean you 
have to agree with it, nor does it require you to give up your own. 
And the fact that you are willing to try to understand their view 
doesn't diminish the power you have to implement your decision, 
and to be clear that your decision is final. 
In fact, the And S.tance is probably the most powerful place to 
stand when engaging in a difficult conversation that requires you to 
-deliver or enforce bad news. If you are breaking up with someone, it 
allows you to say 'Tm breaking up with you because it's the right 
thing for me [here's why], and I understand how hurt you are, and 
that you think we should try again, and I'm not changing my mind, 
and I understand that you think I should have been more clear about 
my confusiop earlier, and I don't think that makes me a bad person,

Don't Assume They Meant It: 
Disentangle Intent from Impact 
The question of who intended what is central to our story about 
what's happening in a difficult situation. Intentions strongly influ-
ence our judgments of others: If someone intended to hurt us, we 
judge them more harshly than if they hurt us by mistake. We're will-
ing to be inconvenienced by someone if they have a good reason; 
we're irritated if we think they just don't care about the impact of 
their actions on. us. Though either blocks our way just as surely, we 
react differently to an ambulance double-parked on a narrow street 
than we do to a BMW. 
The Battle Over Intentions 
Consider the story of Lori and Leo, who have been in a relationship 
for two years and have a recurring fight that is painful to both of 
them. The couple was at a party thrown by some friehds, and Lori 
was about to reach for another scoop of ice cream, when Leo said, 
"Lori, why don't you lay off the ice cream?" Lori, who struggles with 
her weight, shot Leo a nasty look, and the .two avoided each other for 
a while. Later that evening things went from bad to worse: 
LORI: ·1 really resented it at the party, the way you treated me in 
front of our friends. 

Disentangle Intent from Impact 
45 
LEO: The way I treated you? What are you talking about? 
LORI: About the ice cream. You act like you're my father or 
something. You )i:ave this need to control me or put me 
down. 
LEO: Lori, I wasn't trying to hurt you. You said you were on a 
diet, and I'm just trying to help you stick to it. You're so de-
fensive. You hear everything· as an attack on you, even when 
I'm trying to help. 
LORI: Help!? Humiliating me in front of my friends is your idea 
of helping? 
LEO: You know, I just can't win with you. If I say something, you 
think I'm trying humiliate you, and if I don't, you ask me 
why I let you overeat. I am so-sick of this. Sometimes I won-
der· whether you don't start these fights on purpose. 
This conversation left both Lori and Leo feeling angry, hurt, and 
misunderstood. What's worse, it's a conversation they have over and 
over again. They are engaged in a classic battle over intentions: Lori 
accuses, Leo of hurting her on purpose, and· Leo denies it. They are 
caught in a cycle they don't understand.,~nd don't know how to 
break. 
Two Key Mistakes 
There is a way out. Two crucial mistakes in this conversation make 
it infinitely more difficult than it needs to be -
one by Lori and 
one by Leo. Wh~n Lori says "You have this need to control me or put 
me down," she is talking about Leo's intentions. Her mistake is to as-
sume she kn9ws what Leo's intentions are, when in fact she doesn't. 
It's an easy - and debilitating -
mistake to make. And we do it all 
the time. 
Leo's mistake is to assume that once he clarifies that his inten-
tions were good, Lori is no longer justified in being upset. He ex-
plains that he "wasn't trying to hurt" Lori, that in fact he was trying to 
help. And having explained this, he thinks that should be the end of 

46 
The "What Happened?" Conversation 
it. As a result, he doesn't take the time to learn what Lori is really 
feeling or why. This mistake, too, is as common as it is crippling. 
Fortunately, with some awareness, both :µ1istakes can be avoided. 
The First Mistake: Our Assumptions 
About Intentions Are Often Wrong 
Exploring "Lori's mistake" requires us to understand how our minds 
work when devising stories about what others intend, and to learn to 
recognize the set of questionable assumptions upon which these sto-
ries are built. Here's the problem: While we care deeply about other 
people's intentions toward us, we don't actually know what their in-
tentions are. We can't. Other people's intentions exist only in their 
hearts and minds. They are invisible to us. However real and right 
our assumptions about other people's intentions may seem to us, they· 
are often i_ncomplete or just plain' wrong. 
We Assume Intentions from the Impact on Us 
Much of the first mistake can be traced to one basic error: we make 
an attribution about another person's intentions based on the impact 
of their actions on us. We feel hurt; therefore they 1nte°:ded to hurt 
us. We feel slighted; therefore they intended to slight us. Our think-
ing is so automatic that we aren't even aware that our conclusion is 
only an assumption. We are so taken in by our story about what 
they intended that we can't imagine how they could have intended 
anything else. 
We Assume the Worst. The conclusions we draw about inten-
tions based on the impact of others' actions on us are rarely charita-
ble. When a friend shows up late to the movie, we don't think, "Gee, 
I'll bet h~ ran into someone in need." More likely we think, "Jerk. He 
doesn) care about making me miss the beginning of the movie." 

Disentangle Intent from Impact 
47 
When we've been hurt by someone else's behavior, we assume the 
worst. 
Margaret fell into this pattern. She -had had her hip operated on 
by a prominent surgeon, a man she found gruff and hard to talk to. 
When Margaret hobbled in for her first appointment after surgery, 
the receptionist told her that the doctor had unexpectedly extended 
his vacation. Angry, Margaret imagined her wealthy doctor cavorting 
in the. Caribbean with his wife or girlfriend, too self-important and 
inconsiderate to return on schedule. The picture compounded her 
anger. 
When Margaret finally saw the doctor a week later, she asked 
curtly how his vacation had been. He responded that it had been won-
derful. ''I'll bet," she said, wondering whether to raise her concerns. 
But the doctor went on: "It was a working vacation. I was helping set 
up.a hospital in Bosnia. The conditions there are just horrendous." 
Learning what the doctor was really doing didn't erase the incon-
venience Margaret had endured. Yet knowing that he was not acting 
out of selfishness, but from· an unrelated and generous motivation, 
left Margaret feeling sub~antiaJly better about having to wait the ex-
tra week. 
We attribute intentions to others all the time. With business and 
even personal relationships increasingly conducted via e-mail, voice 
mail, faxes, and conference calls, we often have to read between the 
lines to figure out what people really mean. When a customer writes 
"I don't suppose you've gotten to my order yet 
," is he being sar-
castic? Is he angry? Or is he trying to tell you that he knows you're 
busy? Without tone of voice to guide us, it is easy to assume the 
worst. 
We Treat Ourselves· More Charitably. What's ironic - and 
all too human -" about our tendency to attribute bad intentions to 
others is how differently we treat ourselves. When your husband for-
gets to pick up the dry cleaning, he's irresponsible. When you forget 
to book the airline tickets, it's because you're overworked and stressed 
out. When a coworker criticizes your work in front of department 

48 
The "What Happened?" Conversation 
colleagues, she is trying to put you down. When you offer suggestions 
to others in the same meeting, you are trying to be ·helpful. 
When we're the ones acting, we know that much of the time we 
don't intend to annoy, offend, or upstage others. We're wrapped up 
in our own worries, and are often unaware that we're having any 
negative impact on others. When we're the ones acted upon, how-
ever, our story too easily slides into one about bad intentions and bad 
character. 
Are There Never Bad Intentions? Of course, sometimes we 
get hurt because someone meant to hurt us. The person we are deal-
ing with is nasty or inconsiderate, out to make us look bad or steal 
our best friend. But these situations are rarer than we imagine, and 
without hearing from the other person, we can't really know their 
intentions. 
Getting Their Intentions Wrong Is Costly 
Intentions matter, and guessing wrong 1s hazardous to your 
relationships. 
We Assume Bad Intentions Mean Bad Character. Perhaps the 
biggest danger of assuming the other person had bad intentions is 
that we easily jump from "they had bad intentions" to "they are a bad 
person." We settle into judgments about their character that color 
our view of them and, indeed, _affect not only any conversation· we 
might have, but the entire relationship. Once we think we have 
someone figured out, we see all of their actions through that lens, 
and the stakes rise. Even if we don't share our view with them, the 
impact remains. The worse our view of the other person's character, 
the easier it is to justify avoiding them or saying nasty things behind 
their back. 
When you find yourself thinki_ng "That traffic cop is a control 
freak" or "My boss is manipulative" or "My neighbor is impossible," 
ask yourself why this is your view. What is it based on? If it's based on 

Disentangle Intent from Impact 
49 
feeling powerless, fearing manipulation, or being frustrated, notice 
that your conclusion is based solely on the impact of their behavior 
on you - which is not a sufficient basis to be sure of someone else's 
intentions or character. 
Accusing Them of Bad Intentions Creates Defensiveness. Our 
assumptions about other people's intentions can also have a signifi-
cant impact on our conversations. The easiest and most common 
way of expressing these assumptions is with an accusatory question: 
"How come you wanted to hurt me?" "Why do you ignore me.like 
this?" "What have I done that makes you feel it's okay to step all over 
?" 
me. 
We think we are sharing our hurt, frustration,. anger, or confu-
sion. We are trying to begin a cqnversation that will end in greater 
understanding, perhaps some improved behavior, and maybe an 
apology. What they think we are doing is trying to provoke, accuse, or 
malign them. (In other words, they make the same mistaken leap in 
judging our intentions.) And given how frequently our assumptions 
are incomplete or wrong, the ofher person often feels not just ac-
cused, but f~lsely accused. Few .things are more aggravating. 
We should not be surprised, then, that they try to defend them-
selves, or attaGk back. From their point of view, they are defending 
themselves from false accusations. From our point of view, they are 
just being defensive - we're right, they ju.st aren't big enough to ad-
mit it. The result is a mess .. No one learns anything, no one apolo-
gizes, nothing·changes. 
Lori and Leo fall right into this. Leo is defensive throughout, and 
at the end, when he says that he sometimes wonders if Lori "starts 
these fights on purpose," he actually accuses Lori of bad intentions. 
And thus begins a cycle of accusation. If interviewed about their con-
versation afterward, both Lori and Leo would report that they were 
the victim of ~he other's bad intentions. Each would claim that their 
own statements were made in self-defense. Those are the two classic 
characteristics of the cycle: both parties think they are the victim, 
and both think they are acting only t9 defend th~mselves~ This is how 
well-intentioned people get themselves into trouble. 

50 
The "What Happened?" Conversation 
Attributions Can Become Self-Fulfilling. Our assumptions 
about the other person's intentions often come true, even when they 
aren't true to begin with. You think your boss isn't giving you enough 
responsibility~ You assume that this is because she doesn't trust you to 
do the work well. You feel demotivated by this state of affairs, figuring 
that nothing you do will change your boss's mind. Your work suffers, 
and your boss, who hadn't been concerned about your work before, 
is now quite worried. So she gives you even less responsibility than 
before. 
When we think others have bad intentions toward us, it affects 
our behavior. And, in turn, how we behave affects how they treat us. 
Before we know it, our assumption that they have bad intentions 
toward us has come true. 
The Second Mistake: Good Intentions 
Don't Sanitize Bad Impact 
As we've seen, the mistake Lori makes of assuming she knows Leo's 
intentions, though seemingly small, has big consequences. Now let's 
come back to Leo, who makes an equally costly error in the conver-
sation. He assumes that because he had good intentions, Lori should 
not feel hurt. The thinking goes like this: "You said I meant to hurt 
you. I have now clarified that I didn't. So you should now feel fine, 
and if you don't, that's your problem." 
We Don't Hear What They Are Really Trying to Say 
The problem with focusing only on clarifying our intentions is that 
we end up missing significant pieces of what the other person is try-
ing to say. When they say, "Why were you trying to hurt me?" they 
are really communicating two separate messages: first, "I know what 
you intended," and, second, "I got hurt." When we are the person ac-
cused, we focus only on the first message and ignore the second. 
Why? Because we feel the need to defend ourselves. Becc\use Leo 

Disentangle Intent from Impact 
51 
is so busy defending him~elf, he fails to hear that Lori is hurt. He 
doesn't take in what this all means to her, how hurt she is, or why 
these issues are so painful. 
Working to understand what the other person is really say~ng is 
particularly important because when someone says "You intended to 
hurt me" that isn't quite what they mean. A literal focus on inten-
tions ends up clouding the conversation. Often we say "You intended 
to hurt me" when what we really mean is "You don't care enough 
about me." This is an important distinction. 
The father who is too ·busy at work to attend his son's basketball 
game doesn't intend to hurt his son. He would prefer not to hurt his 
son. But his desire not to hurt his son is not as strong as his desire. or 
need to work. Most of us on the receiving end make little distinction 
between "He wanted to hurt me" and "He didn't want to hurt me, 
but he didn't make me a priority." Either way, it hurts. If the father re-
sponds to his son's complaint by saying "I didn't intend to hurt you," 
he's not addressing his son's real concern: "You may not have in-
tended to hurt me, but you- knew you were hurting me, and you did it 
" 
anyway. 
'? 
It is useful to attempt to clarify your intentions. The question is 
when. If you do it at t~e beginning of the conversation, you are likely 
doing it without fully understanding what the other person really 
means to express. 
We Ignore the Complexity of Human Motivations 
Another problem with assuming that good intentiqns sanitize a nega-
tive impact is that intentions are often more compl~x than just 
"good" or "bad." Are Leo's intentions purely angelic? Is he just trying 
to help Lori with her diet? Perhaps h~ .himself is embarrassed by 
Lori's tendency to overeat and felt compelled to say something. 9r 
maybe he wants her to lose weight not so much for herself, but for 
him. If he really cares about her, as he says he does, shouldn't he be 
more aware of how his words affect her? 
As is so often the case, Leo's intentions are probably mixed. He 

52 
The "What Happened?" Conversation 
may not even be fully aware of what is actually motivating him. But 
the answer to the question of what is truly motivating Leo is less im-
_portant than his willingness to ask the question and look for an an-
swer. If his first response to Lori is "No, I had good intentions," then 
he is putting up a barrier to any learning he might get from the con-
versation. And he is sending a message to Lori that says, 'Tm more 
interested in defending myself than I am in investigating the com-
plexities of what might be going on for me in our relationship." 
) 
Interestingly, when people take on the job of thinking hard about 
their own intentions, it sends a profoundly positive message to the 
other person about the importance of the relationship. After all, 
you'd only do that kind of hard work for somebody who matters 
to you. 
We Aggravate Hostility- Especially Between Groups 
This dynamic of attributing intentions, defending ourselves, and ig-
noring the impact we've had on others is especially common in con-
flicts between groups, whether the groups are union members and· 
management, neighborhood organizations and developers, adminis-
trative staff and the professionals they support, or my family and. your 
family. The desire to sanitize impact is especially common in situa-
tions involving issues of "difference," like race, gender, or sexual 
orientation. 
A few years ago a newspaper was experiencing racial strife among 
its workers. African American and Hispanic reporters complained 
about the absence of minority voices at the editorial level, and threat-
ened to organize a boyC:ott unless practices were changed. In re-
sponse, the executive editors met behind closed doors to consider 
what to do. No minority staffers were invited to the meeting. When 
the minority reporters learned of the meeting, they were outraged. 
"They're telling us once again that they don't -care what we have to 
say," said one reporter. 
When one of the white editors heard this, she felt wrongly ac-
cused and sought to clarify the intention of the meeting: "I can see 

Disentangle Intent from Impact 
53, 
why you felt excluded. But that wasn't our intention. It was simply a 
meeting of editors trying to figure out a good next step for how to in-
clude minority voices." The white editor felt that now that her inten-
tions were clarified, the issue of the "meaning of the meeting" was 
over. After all, everything was now clear. But it's never that s.imple. 
The intentions of the white editors are jmportant. What's also impor-
tant is that whether or not the intention was to exclude, people felt 
excluded. And such feelings may take time and thought on every-
one's part to work through. 
Avoiding the Two Mistakes 
The good news is that the two mistakes around intentions and impact 
are avoidable. 
Avoiding the First Mistake: Disentangle Impact a~d Intent 
How can Lori avoid the mistake of attributing intentions to Leo that 
he may- not have? Her first step is simply to recognize that there is a 
difference between the impact of Leo's behavior on her and what 
Leo intended. She can't get anywhere without qisentangling the two. 
Separating impact from intentions requires us to be aware of the 
automatic leap from ''I was hurt" to "You intended to hurt me." You 
can make this distinction by asking yourself three questions: 
1. Actions: "What did the other person actually say or do?" 
2. Impact: "What was the impact of this on me?" 
3. Assumption: "Based on this impact, what assumption am I 
making about what the other person intended?" 
Hold Your View as a Hypothesis. Once you have clearly 
answered these three questions, the next step is to make absolutely 

54 
The "What Happened?" Conversation 
certain that you rec-
ognize that your as-
sumption about their 
intentions is just an 
assumption. -It is a 
guess, a hypothesis. 
Your hypothesis 
is not based on noth-
ing; you know what 
Disentangle Impact and Intent 
Aware of

on other person 
was said or done. But as we've seen, this is not a lot of evidence to go 
on. Your guess might be right and it might be wrong. In fact, your re-
action might even say as much about you as it does about what they 
did. Perhaps you've had a past experience that gives their action spe-
.cial meaning to you. Many people find certain kinds of teasing hos-
tile, for example, because of bad experiences with siblings, while 
others think of teasing ( in moderation) as a way to connect and show 
affection. Given the stakes, however, you can't afford to level an ac-
cusation based on tenuous data. 
Share the Impact on You; Inquire About Their Intentions.You 
can use your answers to the three questions listed above to begin the 
difficult conversation itself: say what the other person did, tell them 
what its impact was on you, and explain your assumption about their 
intentions, taking care to label it as a hypothesis that you are check-
ing rather than asserting to be true . 
. Consider how this would change the beginning of the conversa-
tion between Lo_ri and Leo. Instead of beginning with an accusation, 
Lori can begin by identifying what Leo said, and what the impact 
was on her: 
LORI: You know when you said, "Why don't you lay off the ice 
cream"? Well, I felt hurt by that.' 
LEO: You did? 
LORI: Yeah. 
LEO: I was just trying to help you stay on your diet. Why does 
that make you upset?

The "What Happened?" Conversation 
Avoiding the Second Mistake: .Listen for Feelings, 
and Reflect on Your Intentions 
When we find ourselves in Leo's position - being accused of bad 
intentions - we have a strong tendency to want to defend ourselves: 
"That is not what I intended." We are defending our intentions and 
our character. However, as we've seen, starting here leads to trouble. 
Listen Past the Accusation for the Feelings. Remember that the 
accusation about our bad inte~tions is always made up of two sepa-
rate ideas: (I) we had bad intentions and (2) the other person was 
frustrated, hurt, or embarrassed. Don't pretend they aren't saying the 
first.· You'll want to respond to it. But neither should you ignore the 
second. And if you start by listening and acknowledging the feelings, 
and then return to the question of intentions, it will make your con-
versation significantly easier and more constructive. 
Be Open to Reflecting on the Complexity of Your Intentions. 
When it comes time to consider your intentions, try to avoid the ten-
dency to say "My intentions were pure." We usually think that about 
ourselves, and sometimes it's true. But often, as we've seen, inten-
tions are more complex. 
We can imagine how the initial conversation might have gone if 
Leo followed this advi~e w~th Lori: 
LORI: I really resented it at the party, the way you treated me in 
front of our friends. 
LEO: The way I treated you? What do you mean? 
LORI: About the ice cream. You act like you'r"e my father or 
something. You have this need to control me or put me 
down. 
LEO: Wow. It sounds like what I said really hurt. 
LORI: Of course it hurt. What did you expect? 
LEO: Well, at the time I was thinking that you'd said you were on

a diet, and that maybe I could help you stick to it. But I can 
see how saying something in front of everyone would be em-
barrassing. I wonder why I didn't see that? 
LORI: Maybe you were embarrassed to have to say something. 
LEO: Yeah, maybe. I could have seen you as out of control, 
which is a big issue for me. 
LORI: That's true. And I probably was a little out of control. 
LEO: Anyway, I'm sorry. I don't like hurting you. Let's think 
about what I should do or say, if anything, in situations like 
that. 
LORI: Good idea. 
Understanding how we distort others' intentions, making difficult 
conversations even more difficult, is crucial to untangling what hap-
pened between us. However, there's still one more piece to the 
"What Happened?" Conversation that can get us into trouble ~ the 
question of who is to blame.
