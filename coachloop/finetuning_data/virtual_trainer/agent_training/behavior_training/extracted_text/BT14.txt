About this book 
Why is this topic important? 
The education required over a lifetime cannot be delivered by conventional means. People 
must learn more efficiently and at the time and place of their choosing. E‐learning can 
deliver that education—but only if it is designed to do so. 
Over the past decade, e‐learning has moved from an experimental procedure used to 
teach technical subjects within computer companies to a mainstream staple teaching 
everything from life‐saving medical procedures to spiritual vision. If you are concerned 
with educating others, you cannot ignore e‐learning. 
There are lots of books on instructional design and lots on how to operate particular tools 
to create e‐learning, but few on how to apply instructional design to e‐learning. This is 
that book. 
What can the reader achieve with this book? 
This book provides instructional designers, teachers, faculty, information technologists, 
subject‐matter experts, individual consultants, and others tasked with moving to 
e‐learning a clear path to the goal of effective e‐learning. 
The pragmatic and practical advice in this book is not limited to any particular tool or 
system. Most of the techniques here can be implemented with simple tools you already 
know how to operate.  
You can acquire a rapid, yet systematic, design process that covers the hundreds of 
decisions necessary to create great e‐learning.  
How is this book organized? 
The twelve chapters of this book lead the reader systematically through the decisions 
necessary to design effective e‐learning. It starts with an overview of the design process 
for e‐learning. Then it builds up from small pieces to course‐wide issues. There are three 
chapters on how to use technology to create the learning experiences that really teach. 
Covered are learning games and simulations, guided tours, virtual labs, storytelling, 
guided research, and many other kinds of practice and discovery activities. Next follow 
instructions on how to create tests and other assessments that verify and measure learning 

 
 
 
 
progress. The next two chapters tell how to integrate activities and tests into learning 
objects that completely accomplish learning objectives and how to combine topics and 
activities into lessons that accomplish more ambitious goals. The next chapter covers 
strategic issues, such as whether to include real‐time meetings or an instructor and what 
standards to follow. The book ends with chapters on how to design and teach instructor‐
led e‐learning in the virtual classroom, how to design the visual display and navigation 
scheme within the course.  
Where did this book come from? 
E‐Learning by Design is the logical successor to Designing Web‐Based Training. This book is 
more than a second edition, but not an entirely new work. It evolves the ideas started 
there. 
This book, as its title implies, is squarely about design. It is not about development tools 
or other technologies. Design of e‐learning involves instructional design, but goes beyond 
instructional design to include aspects of media design, software engineering, and 
economics. The goal is to tell readers how to design e‐learning that works as well as the 
best classroom learning. 
This book contains my best advice from my experience creating online learning. Since 
1971, I have designed, built, researched, and evaluated what we now call e‐learning. I 
have worked in electronic media most of my career from perspectives of design, 
management, and technology, 
How can you get the most out of this book? 
Read actively. Skim, scan, skip. Look at the pictures. Find something that interests you 
and read it in detail. 
Where did the examples come from? 
All examples were designed by William and Katherine Horton of William Horton 
Consulting. Unless otherwise noted, all examples were also built by William or Katherine 
Horton. Many of them are on exhibit at horton.com/eld/. We want to thank The Alban 
Institute and Indianapolis Center for Congregations, Brightline Compliance, The Gantt 
Group, Jones International University, The Office of Surface Mining and Reclamation, the 
Veterans Administration Office of Research and Development, and Web Courseworks for 
having us design them and letting us show them. 

 
   
 
 
 
Where is the CD? 
This book has an extensive Web presence with dozens of complete examples and 
supplementary materials. Check it out at: horton.com/eld 
Who created this book? 
William Horton wrote, typed, and indexed it. Katherine Horton designed the layout and 
formatted the book. William and Katherine drew the graphics. Rebecca Taft contributed 
proofreading. William and Katherine Horton suggested the cover design. And Pfeiffer 
took it from there.
