The Participant Experience
Move from …        To
Isolated
Connected
For example, allow for participant introductions at 
the start of each online event.
Uncertain 
Confident
For example, provide specific instructions for 
every online activity.
Distracted
Engaged
For example, start the session with interaction to 
help focus their attention.
Overwhelmed
Simplified
For example, include user-friendly prompts when 
using the platform tools.
Most participants in virtual classes feel isolated and are often uncertain. 
They are distracted by their environment. It’s the facilitator’s responsibility to 
help them feel connected, confident, and engaged, and to have an easy 
experience.

interact with each other for dialogue and 
discussion.

Using Names
5 Guidelines for Using Names in a Virtual Event
Let them know you’ll be 
using names.
Mention it during the warm-up activity and again 
at the start of a session.
Use names in your 
examples.
Say learner names as often as possible, and 
incorporate them into stories and illustrations.
For example, you might say “Let’s use Adam’s 
project as an example. As Adam said earlier…”
Say their name before 
asking a directed 
question, and repeat it 
again after.
Directed questions are targeted to one 
individual. When using this type of question, say 
the person’s name, then ask the question. It may 
also be helpful to say the persons name again 
before inviting them to respond.
Ask directed questions 
that do not have an 
incorrect answer.
Avoid putting people on the spot or 
embarrassing them. Instead, ask opinion-style 
questions that do not have one right answer. In 
other words, if you ask a directed question, 
make sure anything could be a correct response. 
For example, ask “Jack, what do you think about 
this topic?” or “Maria, what’s your experience 
with the process?”
Give options for
responding.
Allow participants the opportunity to “pass” and 
not respond, or to have shared responsibility for 
answers. For example, say “Let’s hear from both 
Jane and Maria. Would one of you be willing to 
go first?” Or, “Those of you dialing in from 
Nashville, what’s your take on this scenario? 
Joe? Michele? Avery? Would one of you weigh 
in?”

Questioning Techniques
Asking questions in the virtual classroom requires different techniques than 
asking them in the traditional classroom. There are two keys:
Be Precise
• Ask specific questions
• Use one question at a time
• Choose simple, 
straightforward words
• Plan questions in advance
• Ask follow-on questions to 
encourage dialogue
• Consider the following 
technique:
Lead with a yes/no question, 
then ask follow on questions 
to expand and elaborate
Be Prescriptive
• Consider the many ways to 
respond in the virtual 
classroom
• Let participants know how to 
respond – which tool to use
• Provide instructions for 
responding
• Set expectations for responses 
(quantity & time)
• Offer variety or choice in 
response method (when 
appropriate)

Skill: Voice and Visuals
Tips for Creating Your Best Voice
Extend the headset 
microphone above 
your mouth
Check your audio connection to ensure the right 
volume – not to loud and not too soft – and avoid 
heavy breathing into the microphone.
Exercise your best 
posture by sitting or 
standing tall
Use your posture to help create a rich sounding 
vocal quality.
Exude enthusiasm and 
energy
Pour energy and enthusiasm into your voice. 
Sound like you are completely enjoying the online 
experience!
Exaggerate your voice
Avoid sounding monotone. Add vocal variety to 
emphasize key words and phrases.
End sentences strong
Keep your voice from trailing off at the end of 
sentences. Also be aware if your voice rises at 
the end of a sentence, to avoid sounding unsure 
of yourself.
Tips for Presenting Yourself on Webcam
Place camera at eye 
level
Move your webcam to a spot that centers your 
face on screen instead of looking down to it.
Put lighting in front 
Have a light source in front of you instead of to 
the side or behind you.
Place appropriate 
items in the 
background
Be aware of what’s in view of the camera. Have 
appropriate items of interest that do not distract.
Position yourself the 
correct distance
Use the “palm above head” guide as a reference 
point for centering your shoulders on screen.
