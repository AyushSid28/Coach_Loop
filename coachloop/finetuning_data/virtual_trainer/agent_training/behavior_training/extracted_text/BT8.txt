Introduction
By definition, a facilitator is someone who skillfully creates and implements a plan that progresses a group of people through 
identified goals and learning objectives. A facilitator takes an unbiased approach to these goals, making it possible to achieve 
consensus during times of disagreement and refocus the group on the common goals.
A trainer, however, does not take an active role in the attainment of goals, but rather takes the lead in providing a body of 
knowledge for a group.
These two distinct forms of presentation hold utmost value in the world of professional development and increase of 
productivity and profitability.
As a trainer, or “Sage on the Stage,” you have the responsibility of divulging new information that will be utilized for the 
betterment of your participant. As a facilitator, or “Guide on the Side,” you will be accountable to working with your 
participants to find the route to better productivity.
Without knowledge, there can be no action. These two roles are dependent on one another. When training and facilitation 
have been practiced well, the participants will take ownership in the decisions made and goals that are determined.
Have you ever participated in a training program that left you feeling more confident and competent – one in which you really 
got a lot out of the learning experience? Or, have you ever taken a workshop that left you disappointed, confused or maybe 
even angry? What makes for a great presentation, training program or learning experience? The answer to that question could 
be a lot of things – the content, the learning experience, the participants in the class, etc. However, if you think back to a class 
or workshop that you truly enjoyed, the quality of the facilitator is probably one of the reasons why you liked it.
For a facilitator to be great, he/she must understand how adults learn. To assist you in this process, participate in this learning example.

Learning Example:
Below are the directions from an office to a house. Read through the directions and study them for 20-30 seconds only. Then, 
cover the note with a separate sheet of paper and answer the questions on the next page.
From the office, take the road that leads out of the parking lot and follow it right, out past the security building and the gate 
until it comes to the first “T”. Turn left, by a big tree, it veers left again, then, you will come to a triple fork. If you go straight, 
you will go over the bridge – don’t do that. If you go left, it will take you under the viaduct and towards the lake, that’s the 
wrong way. Take the right branch and, at the next branch, take another right around the roundabout where you go to the 
second road. That’s 116 S. It says south, but it really goes east. Stay straight on this road and when you get to the end; my house 
will be on the left.
Answer the following questions: 
1.	 Where is the parking lot?
2.	 What do you have to pass to get out of the office complex?
3.	 What do you see just before you get to the second fork?
4.	 Do you go over or under the viaduct?
5.	 What highway do you take?
Now, study the map for 20-30 seconds. Then, cover the map and answer the questions on the next page.

Answer the following questions: 
1.	 Where is the parking lot?
2.	 What do you have to pass to get out of the office complex?
3.	 What do you see just before you get to the second fork?
4.	 Do you go over or under the viaduct?
5.	 What highway do you take?
How did you do? If you are like most people, you found the second set of directions easier to follow.
The same information, presented in different ways, has a significant impact on learning.  As a facilitator, you control how 
the information in your session will be presented. Understanding some basic learning principles will help you present your 
content in a way that will have a positive impact on learning for your participants.
Understanding Learning Styles - Who Are My Learners?
Although every person has an individual style (or learning modality) for organizing and understanding new information, 
most people have similar preferences for acquiring and learning new information. Most individuals prefer to learn through 
one of the following three channels:
• 
Seeing — visual learner
• 
Hearing — auditory learner
• 
Touching/Doing — kinesthetic learner
As facilitators, it is our job to utilize these modalities to engage our learners. This can be done in a variety of different ways. 
The two forms we will look at here are:
1.	
Room set up and facilitator movement
2.	
Language use and activity design 
Room set up and facilitator movement
The diagram below explains how the modalities are generally used by a facilitator just by how he/she sets up a room and 
moves from place to place in a room while facilitating.

Visual Area- The facilitator uses large gestures to 
point and model, a PowerPoint or visual is often 
used, and voice is increased so participants tune in.
Kinesthetic Area- The facilitator guides discussion 
and participant activities in this area. It is where 
participants get to experience the content and 
actively process the information through movement 
with manipulatives, modeling experiences, and 
facilitator guided questioning and discussion.
Auditory Area- The facilitator does most of the 
lecturing and speaking to the audience in this area.

Language Use and Activity Design
No individual is solely one type of learner. Rather, they are a combination of all three. However, most learners have a pref­
erence for acquiring information through one channel. Therefore, as a facilitator, you must try to engage all three types of 
learners in your programs because each audience will be made up of a combination of participants that prefer each style. Each 
learning style is unique, and each person is often a combination of styles, it is important to understand the strengths and 
weaknesses of all three types of learners. Let’s check out some tips of how to speak and actively engage each learning modality.
Visual Learners
Visual learners learn best by seeing new information. Visual learners may prefer verbal information (i.e., reading information 
or seeing words) or nonverbal information (i.e., pictures or graphics that help represent the information).

Auditory Learners
Auditory learners learn best by listening to new information.
Auditory Learner
Learning Style Clues
Learning Style Teaching Tips
• Prefer to get information by listen­
ing — need to hear information to 
understand
• Sometimes have difficulty under­
standing written information and ex­
pressing themselves through writing
• Unable to read body language and 
facial expressions well
• May have trouble following written 
directions
• May say, “It sounds good to me”
• Explain information orally rather than relying on learners to read and synthe­
size directions or charts
• Encourage open discussions and orally sharing outcomes of exercises
Use voice fluctuations when appropriate to emphasize a key fact, or element to 
remember
Use verbal repetition on key points to allow auditory learners to hear and pro­
cess the information more than once
Use call backs - a call back is a technique where the facilitator asks participants 
to verbally respond with a specific phrase cued word or question. For example: 
“when you hear VCPR, you say Relationships”
Use words or cues like: “tune in”, “listen up”, “sounds like”, “take note”…
Kinesthetic Learners
Kinesthetic learners prefer hands-on experience to learn and acquire new skills or information.

From Concept to Understanding – The Experiential Learning Cycle 
Each participant in a workshop brings their 
own unique understanding of the world 
around them based on the experiences 
they have acquired in their lives so far. This 
preconceived understanding effects how they 
perceived all new information. We cannot 
control that, but we must manage their 
thought processes during our time together 
so each participant leaves the workshop with 
the same understanding of the concepts being 
shared.

PhD. David Kolb designed the model on the 
left to explain how people take a concept and 
turn it into working knowledge by moving 
through four quadrants. A person may 
enter this cycle at any stage with a specific 
concept. Kolb (1984) notes that “Learning 
is the process whereby knowledge is created 
through the transformation of experience. 
Knowledge results from the combination of 
grasping experience and transforming it.”

A learner will gain the deepest understanding if they move through all parts of the model. For example, learning to teach may 
flow through the following experiences:
• 
Concrete Experience/Feeling - Having an experienced teacher guide you as you teach someone else.
• 
Reflective Observation/Watching - Observing how other people teach.
• 
Abstract Conceptualization/Thinking – Gaining knowledge on and thinking of different methods of teaching.
• 
Active Experimentation/Doing – Using your own gained skills to achieve your own teaching style.
Use the chart below to help guide how you will move your participants through the four quadrants of the learning cycle to 
increase their likelihood of understanding?

From Concept to Understanding- How the Brain Processes Information
Now that we have an idea of how a learning cycle works, let’s look at how this fits into how the brain processes information. 
For a piece of information to reach long term memory use, thus creating a desired thought or action, it must be processed by 
the brain a minimum of seven times. The schematic of the flow of knowledge to understanding looks like this:
	
The next few pages explain each part of this flow chart in more detail.
Sensory Receptors
Every day your five senses receive hundreds of thousands of bits of information and data. This information is passed to the 
brain for processing.
Barriers to Learning
As the brain processes information, several factors can create barriers to learning. These include:
• 
Emotional Barriers –Needs, attitudes and emotions that get in the way of communication. For example, suppose a 
participant has had an argument with his/her spouse prior to coming to the session. He/She will be more focused on 
reliving the argument than they are on your presentation. Or, if previous training experiences have been “painful” or 
unproductive, they are likely to come in with negative expectations, which will impede future learning.

• 
Physical Barriers –Several environmental factors can also impede learning. The temperature of a room, extraneous 
noise, sitting too long in one position, and outside distractions are all examples of physical barriers to learning.
Effective facilitators analyze their target audience and facility before a session begins to both identify and remove potential 
learning barriers.
Processing of Information
Much of the information the brain receives is not important to an individual. As sensory data is received, the brain evaluates it 
for relevance and value. Information that is not deemed as valuable or relevant is not likely to be retained.
Short Term Memory
Short term memory provides temporary storage of small amounts of information on which you have focused. This is the 
memory storage you use when you look up a phone number and remember it just long enough to press the buttons on the 
phone. After a minute or two passes, you forget the number.
Short term memory can only hold about seven to nine bits of information at a time. However, short term memory will also let 
you store information in chunks. Chunking will allow participants to increase the amount of information they can briefly retain.
For example, if you were shown this list of letters and numbers for ten seconds and asked to remember it, you probably 
couldn’t...  there is too much information for your short term memory to hold:
229FBISTAFFDID7SETSBY9
However, if you split the data into chunks, you can assign some sort of meaning to each group, and you may be able to retain this 
larger amount of information in your short term memory.
229 FBI STAFF DID 7 SETS BY 9
Long Term Memory
Information from short term memory is transferred to long term memory by focusing our attention on it, thinking about it, 
considering its meaning, and relating it to other information already stored in long term memory.
The brain can store information in its long term memory indefinitely.
Things that can improve the storage and recall of information in long term memory:
• 
When introducing new concepts, relate it to other concepts with similar meanings. The brain seeks to make sense 
and “organize” new information by comparing it to similar concepts you have already learned. The use of analogies 
is an effective way to communicate complex ideas.
• 
Present information using multiple modalities (auditory, visual, and kinesthetic). Learning occurs by the encoding 
of new information in permanent long term memory. According to a theory called Dual Encoding, content com­
munications with text, graphics and activity sends multiple “memory codes”. Having two opportunities for encoding 
into long term memory increases the likelihood that content will be retained and remembered.
• 
Practice! Provide participants with opportunities to use the information you have given them. The more they use 
the information in relevant situations or simulations, the more likely they are to retain it.

A Guide to Effective Facilitation  •  10
To open the mind to the learning process, information must be more important or relevant than the barriers that inhibit 
learning. Not barriers we are able to control. Conveniently though, there are a number of barriers we as facilitators can control. 
In the table below, list all of the potential barriers your audience members may experience prior to and during your session. 
Then, working in pairs, generate a list of things you could do to break through these barriers.

Stimulating Adult Learners - What’s In It For Me?
Adults don’t learn the way children learn. Teaching adults as if they are children in a classroom is not only ineffective, it also is 
counterproductive because:
• 
Adults are mature — they don’t have the desire to learn just because they are in training
• 
Adults want to know What’s In It For Me (WIIFM) — they want to see how the information you are presenting is 
directly related to their current, specific needs and concerns
• 
Adults bring unique experiences to the training — include opportunities that allow participants to share their 
knowledge and experience. This makes the participants feel invested and valuable to the training.
Therefore, create learning experiences for adults by:
• 
Engaging the audience in learning and problem-solving
• 
Offering opportunities for practice, application and discussion
In the space below, brainstorm some WIIFMs (i.e., What’s In It For Me) that you can share with 
participants during the training.

A Guide to Effective Facilitation  •  11
Creating and Using Learning Objectives for Adults
Think about the last time you planned a long driving trip — you probably used a map (paper or virtual) and tried to figure out 
the best way to make it to your destination. You may have decided to take only highways, to make the trip shorter. Or you may 
have decided that even though it would take a little longer, it would be more interesting to take a few detours along the way. 
Despite your decisions, you knew that without your map or GPS, it would have taken you much longer to arrive at your end 
destination, if you ever made it there.
Learning objectives act much like this map, providing a written description of the path you will follow in helping training 
participants arrive at their destination of increased knowledge or improved performance.
A learning objective is a statement of what you want the participants to be able to know and/or do differently at the end of the training.
To accomplish this, learning objectives often are written in a format similar to this:
Following today’s session, you will be able to:
• 
Describe the implications of key agricultural trends on your business
• 
Identify the four types of value
• 
Create segments of customers based on value
• 
Quantify the value-in-use of your products and services
• 
Communicate your differential advantage
• 
Create an action plan for improvement
Using learning objectives helps the adult learner understand exactly what is expected and sets the framework for what the 
training will include. Once the objectives are shared, the brain will start to process stored information (or memories) related to 
the objective and automatically do a self-assessment of where they are compared to the objective.
Using Learning Objectives
Present learning objectives at the beginning of your training to:
• 
Help orient learners to what you will be covering during the day
• 
Ensure that all objectives are covered
Regularly refer back to the objectives, to show participants what has been addressed and to do informal assessments to see if 
the participants are learning what is expected from the training. If many of the participants are not meeting the objectives, 
perhaps the concept needs to be taught again from another perspective.
Take a minute to consider the following:
1) In one sentence, how would you describe the purpose of an upcoming training you will conduct?
2) What are the objectives for this training? Identify at least 3.
• 
• 
• 
3) What are two strategies you can use to ensure that participants are aware of the objectives throughout the training?

Attention vs. Retention with the Adult Learner
Attention is the mental ability to take notice of something, retention is the ability to process something and put it into memory 
(Middendorf & Kalish, 1994). Adults can listen for 90 minutes with attention but only for 20 minutes with retention. Why do 
we forget information? Sometimes we forget new information because it is not useful to us. Other times we forget it because 
of the way the information was presented to us; we may have been paying attention but not experiencing retention. As a 
facilitator of information, we must tap into individual learning styles (modalities) and guide participants through the experi­
ential and mental processing of concepts into retained understanding (or memory). Some general rules of thumb to increase 
retention are to:
• 
Change presentation techniques every 20 minutes.
• 
Remember that most adults can only listen with complete attention for two to three minutes. Ask for participation 
every few minutes.
• 
Make sure participants see real-life value in everything you are presenting.
Implement experiences that target all three learning modalities (visual, auditory, and kinesthetic).
Try to gives participants’ experiences that allow them to engage fully in the learning cycle (feeling, watching, thinking, 
doing).
Repeat key concepts with different perspectives multiple times (remember, the brain typically has to process information 
at least 7 times for it to become long term memory).
Strategies for Retention - How Will I Make This Training Stick?
Think about important skills you have either learned, or haven’t learned so well, over time. For the skills or information that 
you remember, what about your learning experience helped you retain this information? For the information that you can’t 
remember as well, why do you feel that it didn’t “stick”?
Even the best-written training programs about the most important topics can be a waste of time if the participants don’t 
remember the information. Incorporating activities that stimulate different types of learners and keeping in mind the learning 
cycle are key to helping participants retain information. Below are some principles of adult education to keep in mind to help 
participants retain information.
1. Think in Pictures
If someone says the word “apple,” what comes to mind? The letters a-p-p-l-e? Or a picture of a ripe, juicy, delicious apple 
with a leaf still attached to the stem?
• 
Show diagrams, pictures, and illustrations of major points in your presentation.
• 
Share stories that help customers visualize the problem and the results.
• 
Take participants into the field or show a video for a “live” demonstration, if possible.
2. Make It Relevant
• 
Training or facilitating is about delivering information that is usable by the audience.
• 
You have to be audience focused. Gear your information towards what is most beneficial to them.
• 
Give them a reason to listen. Use examples that specifically relate to their experience level.
3. Emphasize Key Points
To make sure participants remember key points:
• 
Review or re-state key points at least seven times for maximum retention.
For example: Cover key points in your introduction, during group discussion, when explaining an activity, 
when debriefing the activity, and when summarizing the training.

A Guide to Effective Facilitation  •  13
• 
Present the most important information first, last, or first and last.
Problems, questions, discussion, and exceptions should be handled in the middle of the presentation.
• 
People remember things that are outstanding or different.
Find a way to emphasize key points with a hands-on experience, a field visit, color diagrams or a team prob­
lem-solving exercise.
Take a moment to think about an upcoming training. Create a list of strategies you could apply to help retention of the main 
concepts and identify where you would apply the strategy. The more thought and preparation a facilitator puts into the train­
ing, the more likely it will be viewed as a success by the audience.
Retention Strategy
Where applied
Six Basic Facilitation Principles
1.	 For learning to occur, learners or participants must perceive information by using their five senses. Each of our senses has 
different processing capabilities. Almost 95% of our sensory input is provided by sight and hearing. However, the more 
senses we engage, the more we perceive.
Facilitation Principle: Direct your instruction at more than one sense at a time.
2.	 Once information is perceived, it must be processed by our brains. The short term memory capacity of the brain is limited. 
Therefore, the brain can process only five to nine items at a given time.
Facilitation Principle: Limit the amount of information you provide to participants. Focus on the critical content 
to facilitate the information processing.
3.	 In a given day, our senses are bombarded with thousands of pieces of information. Our brain and nervous system 
automatically select what is relevant to us. Information that captures our attention and is relevant is more likely to be 
processed and moved into long term memory.
Facilitation Principle: Create messages that capture participants’ attention and are relevant to their needs. Use 
examples and analogies that relate to the participants’ previous experiences.
4.	 Our long term memory has almost limitless capacity. As we perceive information, our brain begins to organize and try to 
make sense of it. However, we cannot always retrieve information we have processed.
Facilitation Principle: Organize information you present into meaningful bits or chunks. Use strategies which 
require participants to link new information with prior knowledge. Use metaphors, graphs, tables and images to 
encourage this process.
5.	 The more participants interact with the information; the more likely it is to be remembered.
Facilitation Principle: Provide plenty of opportunities for your participants to “practice” using new information 
by creating activities for key concepts and letting participants discuss the content.
6. Three internal factors influence how well we learn: 1. Our prior knowledge (previous background, experiences and 
education), 2. Our ability (general intelligence, learning ability and performance outcomes of a specific skill) and 3. Our 
motivation (how much value do we attribute to learning and what are the benefits of learning it).
Facilitation Principle: Assess the knowledge, ability and motivation of your audience. If your audience has limited 
prior knowledge, organize it into usable “chunks” and explain concepts using easily understood analogies and 
examples. Provide plenty of opportunities for participants to practice using the information. Motivate participants 
by showing them the relevance of the information you are sharing and explain how it will benefit them.

Improving Facilitation Skills - Physical Delivery
Use Gestures - should help make a point, not distract. Do not pace or stay in the same spot. Taking a step can help to empha­
size a point.
Limit Distractions - monitor your movements. Make sure you are not doing something distracting (tapping a pen, playing 
with change in pocket, etc.).
Tone and Pace
• 
Projection – make sure the person in the back of the room can hear you.
• 
Speed – people hear faster than we speak so talk at a good conversation pace.
• 
Fillers – watch for “ahs” and “ums”.
• 
Direction – Talk to the audience, not the visual aids.
Enthusiasm
• 
Creates mood and atmosphere. If you do not get excited about the topic then don’t expect your participants to!!
• 
Practice, Practice, Practice! Make sure you know what you want to say and how long it will take you to say it. No one 
likes when training sessions run long.
Despite the best planning and preparation for a training, it can fall short if the facilitator fails to prepare and plan for the actual 
presentation of the training.
Facilitating Discussion & Handling Questions
Following how the brain processes information and Kolb’s learning cycle, discussion too should guide the participants’ 
thought process through a series of steps that lead to new or deeper understanding. A purposeful discussion will flow through 
the following question cycle:
Discussions can be very valuable, because they allow participants to share and build on their own experiences. If carefully 
crafted, they can be very rewarding and purposeful for the training. Here is a simplified guide to creating discussion:
• 
Start by introducing a ”What” question and flow through the question cycle.
When asking the “So What” questions, listen for a responses that leads the discussion to the key point that you are 
aiming for and ask “Now What” questions off of that response.
New Information or Activity
Now What
Ask participants to discuss 
where or how they can apply 
this new information or skill 
gained.
What

• 
If responses are shouted from the audience, acknowledge the speaker, summarize the statement, and write it on the flipchart.
• 
Seek group input on the comments — do they agree or disagree?
• 
Ask for specific examples to support — or share your own.
Make sure to use a variety of different questions to generate a variety of responses. Three common types of questions include:
• 
Open questions have no right or wrong answer. They encourage the participant to get involved in the topic. For 
example: “How do you feel about the relationship with your veterinarian?”.
• 
Closed questions have a factual answer. They are often a short answer, rather than the explanation you ask for in 
an open question. For example: “What are three benefits of having a professional working relationship with your 
veterinarian?” 
• 
Clarifying questions ask for examples of the topic you are presenting. For Example: “When would you contacted a 
veterinarian about a question related to animal drug use and withdrawal times?”
As a facilitator, the key is to guide the discussion through a series of questions that help the audience “think through” concepts 
and apply them. If a discussion should lead to a change in thought or action for participants, be sure to check-in and allow 
participants to process how they implement the new information. Keep a keen eye out to watch for understanding. The follow­
ing are some cues to look for:
• 
Do the participants seem engaged or do they look disconnected?
• 
Are they doing other things…making their “to-do” list due to boredom? 
• 
Signs of understanding – Are they staying engaged in the discussion and nodding with understanding of the information?
• 
Signs of confusion – Are they trying to see where you are in the printed information or looking at other participants 
trying to get clarification? Sometimes, participants may get off on a tangent that you have not planned on, but that is 
very important.
• 
Ask participants if they’d like to continue the discussion.
• 
If time is tight; suggest putting the issue in the “parking lot.”
• 
To refocus energy, look for a segue way into the next topic to be covered.
• 
However, don’t end a good discussion just to stay on time. Rather, encourage participants to decide what information 
they might like to condense so they can continue.
Often, particularly during a discussion or lecture, participants will have questions about the material. Some presenters believe 
that if the audience has questions, the material wasn’t covered effectively. However, if participants are truly engaged, they 
should have questions! To handle questions:
• 
Confirm you understand the question
• 
Respond directly
• 
Admit if you don’t know the answer/tell them you will find out
• 
Encourage others to contribute
You can draw in your audience, or turn them away simply by how you handle the first question.

Growing as a Facilitator
Many people believe that a person is either born with good presentation skills or they aren’t. And indeed, some people are 
naturally more enthusiastic and engaging than others and some of us have to work at it. Either way, training that is delivered 
well, is delivered by an individual who is aware of the basics of good presentation skills.
Think about one of your best training or educational experiences.
What made this experience so outstanding?
What did the facilitator/teacher do or say that made the experience positive?
Each training experience is unique, as is each facilitator’s natural and trained ability to deliver information purposefully to an 
audience. You may have noticed, among an assortment of other skills, good facilitators focus on the learner and incorporate a 
variety of different training techniques to teach.

A Guide to Effective Facilitation  •  17
Focusing on the Learner
Learner-focused training seeks to get learner buy-in throughout the training.
• 
Share the significance of the information you are providing (i.e., remind them “What’s In It For Me?”).
• 
Create an environment where participants want to learn:
• 
Ensure physically comfortable conditions
• 
Help participants “save face” by avoiding potentially embarrassing activities and comments
• 
Encourage collaborative rather than competitive activities
• 
Position yourself as a co-learner.
Incorporating Training Techniques
One of the greatest challenges of using new and different training techniques lies in figuring out how to best incorporate these 
techniques. We have talked about many technical aspects of adult learning and facilitation in this guide so far, and it may seem 
overwhelming to think about incorporating them all. You will grow as a facilitator with each training you do. Take it slow and 
incorporate new techniques one at a time. Once comfortable with a technique, add another, and so on. From a big picture view 
point, here are a few facilitation hints to keep in mind as you guide an audience through a series of information:
1.	 When asking questions of the group, mix up the kind of response process you want to use. You can ask them to re­
spond spontaneously, in writing, or give them a time limit. Again, your choice of response mechanisms should depend 
upon the type of information you are trying to gather.
2.	 Vary the kind of discussion techniques you use. Do some large groups, some small groups, and maybe some pairs. Each 
method has value; it all depends on what you want your final outcome to be.
3.	 Use flip charts to capture ideas generated from your discussions. These charts can begin to collect information that will 
be valuable throughout your training or for post training actions.
4.	 Don’t let one participant monopolize the discussion. Encourage others to share. Call on those who haven’t contributed 
much. Most of all make the group comfortable enough so that sharing their ideas is a positive experience. Remember, 
your ultimate goal is to get everyone as excited as you are about your training topic.
5.	 Be prepared for negative comments or disbelief about some of the information you will share. First and foremost, take 
a breath and think before you respond. Dissenting opinions aren’t bad; if handled well, they can make for some inter­
esting discussion. Remember that everyone is entitled to an opinion, even if you don’t agree.
6.	 Prepare follow-up questions that get people thinking when the discussion isn’t moving forward. It is very difficult to 
generate ideas when no one is talking.
7.	 No matter what you do, vary your facilitation techniques and your style. Remember, if you are bored, so are they.
Platform Delivery Skills
The final component of good delivery lies in the actual platform delivery skills, or the way the information is actually 
delivered. Keep these tips for effective delivery in mind.
• 
Speak slowly, clearly, and loudly.
• 
Speak conversationally. Think of yourself as having a personal conversation with every person in the room.
• 
Let your physical delivery help reinforce your training.
• 
Rather than roaming around, stand in a few spots. Move into a new spot when you incorporate a new training 
technique, address a new topic, etc.
• 
Use your gestures to emphasize key points. Keep your arms at your sides and use them to highlight important information.
• 
Keep your eyes on the audience. You should maintain eye contact for at least 80% of the presentation.

A Guide to Effective Facilitation  •  18
• 
Use notes as a prompt. Keep them close, but not in front of your body.
• 
Talk to the audience, not your visual aid. Use your visuals to stay on track, but don’t read from them!
• 
Exude enthusiasm. The audience will only be as excited as you are about the topic.
• 
Share reference handouts as needed. This prevents participants from flipping ahead. If you want participants to refer­
ence the material, then you will need to pass the materials out before the training. However, try to keep the number of 
handouts passed out to a minimum, as passing out papers can be distracting.
• 
Avoid a podium. It puts a barrier between you and the audience, and tempts distractions.
Preparing for the Presentation
No matter how exciting or timely the concepts you are communicating, the delivery will determine the impact. Therefore, 
experience indicates the following rules to implement before the training to maximize success:
• 
Effective facilitation means adequate preparation. Spend time becoming familiar with the subject matter and the 
materials that support your presentation. Customize the materials to address those issues that are unique to your orga­
nization. Do a “dry run” to help you feel comfortable with the materials. This goes a long way in establishing yourself 
as a credible information source and competent presenter.
• 
Review the group activities and the procedures for each. Based on the aforementioned items (agenda, number of 
participants) identify any activities that may be inappropriate and substitute with a more appropriate activity that will 
accomplish the same results. Decide how you will assign particular jobs, or roles, within the activities that each group 
will complete.
• 
Identify the necessary materials (e.g., paper, pens, markers) for each and every group activity that may take place 
during your presentation. This preparation allows for smooth transitions from training to facilitating group activities.
• 
Choose and design the right timeframe for your group session. You may be able to cover your content in a few 
hours, or you might need an entire day. If you have a lot of content to cover but find it difficult to find large chunks of 
time, space it over several days. Choose a time of the day that fits the flow of your business and the schedule of your 
participants. 
• 
Create a positive learning environment. If you are facilitating these materials at your own location or off-site, make 
sure the environment is as distraction free as possible. Ask participants to arrange not to be interrupted by phone calls 
and other day-to-day issues. Make sure you have all materials lined up and readily available to set the expectation that 
you have come prepared to facilitate and they should be ready to learn.
If working with a colleague, clearly identify the role of each presenter. Go through and identify which person is responsible for 
each part of the presentation, as well as who will be responsible for which role during group activities. 
• 
“If you feed them, they will come” is an old presenter’s adage.
Providing refreshments may be helpful to keep your audience focused. A break table in the back of the room, with plen­
ty of coffee, tea, and juice is always a good option. If your session will be more than a few hours, snacks are a good idea. 
Keep it something simple and easy to set up. If your session is all day, definitely make refreshments part of your plan. 
Being (and appearing) prepared is the single most important factor to how successful the training will feel for both 
the participants and facilitator. Prior to your next training, take some time and create a chart as follows to help 
visualize and plan what the training will look like. This exercise also helps point out what learning styles you are 
teaching to during the training.

Adapting an Activity that “Bombs”
Not every activity will go as planned, no matter how much preparation you made. Thus, it is key to be able to modify or adapt 
to the group if an activity fails. Below is a list that can be used to help trouble shoot issues with an activity:
• 
If the structure of the activity is too loose, do a walk-through of the activity, modeling the methods to attain the de­
sired outcomes.
• 
If the structure is too tight, use a debriefing session after the activity to create a learning experience, even if the con­
fines of the activity itself did not allow for it.
• 
If the pace of the activity is too slow, reduce the time limits. This moves the pace along forces all groups to focus and 
hopefully accomplish the task in a timely manner.
• 
If the pace is too fast, place minimum time requirements on each part of the activity, forcing the participants to focus 
on the instructional message of the activity.
• 
If the participants are getting bored, change the rules to create a more competitive atmosphere. Make sure to keep the 
instructional message in mind, not just competition.
• 
If the competition becomes too intense, de-emphasize the scoring atmosphere and emphasize hard work and good 
critical thinking. Avoid comparing individual participants. It is also possible to give each individual a different goal for 
the activity, thus eliminating the competitive nature of direct goal achievement.
• 
If the participants are having too much fun and not accomplishing anything, halt the progress of the activity and do a 
“mid-point” discussion, refocusing the group on the intended outcomes of the activity.
• 
If you are intruding in the activity too much, create an anecdotal record of the individual’s behaviors during the activi­
ty, thus making yourself an observer only. 
• 
If you are being ignored by the participants, become a participant yourself and make a specific announcement to each 
group as you enter the activity.

Handling Disruptive Participants
Most of the fears that surround the facilitation of professional meetings are focused on the management of the participants 
and not the execution of the materials. The next few pages will focus on some of the major forms of disruption during 
presentations and offer a few strategies for overcoming the interference.
Handling Disruptive Talking Behaviors
• 
The participant talks too much.
• 
Call on others
• 
Interrupt the person with a question directed at another participant
• 
Acknowledge the comment and involve others. “Jay, that was quite insightful. Matthew, what are your views on 
this issue?”
• 
The participant does not talk.
• 
Direct a question to the silent participant or ask him/her to summarize the comments of another participant.
• 
Have comments directed in smaller groups, like at a table or to a neighbor.
• 
Have participants write responses on an index card and facilitate the discussion through the use of the cards.
• 
The participant talks in technical jargon.
• 
Compliment the participant on his or her expertise and request a simplified version, in “laymen’s terms.”
• 
Ask the other participants to explain the response to you, ensuring that everyone in the group will get a reason­
able understanding of the response.
• 
The participant uses excessive humor.
• 
Thank the participant for adding a light touch to the discussion, and request that comments directly relate to the topic.
• 
Ignore the humorous comment and follow it with a serious remark.
• 
The participant talks in an excessively serious fashion.
• 
Bring in a light tone to the conversation directly after the participant’s comments.
• 
The participant talks to someone else on the side.
• 
Politely request that the comments be shared for the benefit of all.
• 
Ask one of the participants to make a direct comment about the previous remark that was being ignored.
• 
The participant talks only to the facilitator or trainer.
• 
Emphasize that the meeting is a dialogue among all participants.
• 
Avoid eye contact and move away from the participant.
• 
Avoid commenting on the participant’s remarks and wait for someone else to comment.
Handling Time-Related Disruptive Behaviors
• 
The participant behaves impatiently, not wanting to “waste time” in discussion.
• 
Be specific in the time allotments for each portion of the discussion.
• 
Involve the impatient participant in the discussion by soliciting his or her comments on the topic.
• 
The participant wastes time on off-topic discussions.
• 
Ask the participant a new, directed question.
• 
Ask specific questions of the other participants to redirect the discussion.
• 
The participant arrives late and leaves early.
• 
Avoid summarizing what was missed as this only rewards the tardy nature of the participant.
• 
Start on time and end on time.
• 
The participant is interrupted by messages, phone calls, or pages.
• 
Emphasize that common courtesy would allow us to deactivate devices that will inhibit the others in the group.
• 
Provide appropriate breaks for activities such as checking messages or returning calls.

A Guide to Effective Facilitation  •  21
Handling Disruptive Interpersonal Issues
• 
The participant constantly seeks attention.
• 
Ignore show-off comments and behaviors.
• 
Interrupt the person and ask for comments or remarks from other participants.
• 
The participant challenges others’ statements.
• 
Thank the participant for playing “the devil’s advocate.” Suggest that he or she take on the advocacy role from 
time to time.
• 
Draw attention to the criticism of the process not the person. Shift from personal attacks to attacks of the solu­
tion or the process.
• 
Assign roles of “positive” and “negative” for the discussion and shift them every few minutes.
• 
The participant refuses to participate.
• 
Divide the large group in to smaller groups and request that everyone take turns in the smaller groups sharing 
his or her comments.
• 
Use index cards to elicit responses and facilitate the sharing of each person’s comments.
Hopefully through employing the strategies for preparing, executing, and handling the disruptions during your presentation, 
you will provide a truly valuable learning experience for each participant of your presentation.
Facilitating Webinars
Enhanced technology means that we now have the capacity to deliver training via webinar or web-conferencing tools. 
However, there are unique considerations that should be taken into account when conducting a training session via the 
Internet. The following are facilitation tips to consider before, during and after a webinar.
Pre-Webinar:
• 
Decide ahead of time if the training session will be entirely Web-based or if you will have some participants meet 
face-to-face. Often, meeting coordinators try to have at as many people as possible meet face-to- face with the rest 
participating via web meeting. This may make those who phone-in feel like “second-class” citizens and cause them to 
disengage. Keep in mind, they may miss a gesture or facial expression that the others see or they don’t see a whiteboard 
that everyone else can.
• 
Survey the attendees ahead of time in order to determine what type of Internet connection they have (high-speed or 
dial-up) and ensure that participants have the technology required to participate.
• 
If a participant has dial-up, the webinar software likely will not work well. In this case, be sure to send the docu­
ments before the webinar, and have them follow along on their computer by referring to page or slide numbers.
• 
Make sure participants know which time zone the session is using.
• 
Distribute all needed materials to participants ahead of the webinar. Be sure to allow several days lead time so par­
ticipants won’t have to wait for large files to arrive or download. Be sure to distribute the training purpose, agenda, 
ground rules, PowerPoints and other documents that may be referenced during the session.
• 
Log on to the webinar program you will be using and load all documents that may be used during the training ahead 
of time. This will avoid delays as you move between documents during the training.

A Guide to Effective Facilitation  •  22
Effective Ground Rules for Webinars
Establish and distribute a set of ground rules before the training. These ground rules might include:
• 
Log on 15 minutes before the start of the meeting, since some online products require downloads and installation.
• 
Review all meeting documents prior to the start of the meeting.
• 
Preparation is key to a successful Web-based meeting. Be sure to have all necessary documents downloaded, reviewed 
and easily accessible before the meeting begins.
• 
Find the ‘Mute’ button on your phone. You will want to place your phone on mute anytime you are not speaking. 
Phone microphones can be very sensitive and pick up sounds that you may not realize.
• 
Log in to the WebEx meeting Web site before calling in. This will allow your name to be associated with the phone line 
you are calling in on. WebEx also has a feature that will have the system place the call directly to call you. Simply log in 
to the meeting, then follow the on- screen instructions that appear.
• 
Be aware of and avoid background noise. If at all possible, find a quiet area to conduct the call. It is also helpful to mute 
the phone line when not speaking during the call.
• 
Never put the phones on hold. This may inadvertently create constant background music, a beeping sound or other 
distracting noises for the other participants.
• 
State your name when you speak. Not all meeting participants can easily distinguish between the sound of your voice 
and that of others.
• 
Speak as clearly and precisely as possible. While a land line is often more reliable than wireless service, speaking clearly 
can help others understand no matter what type of phone device you are using.
• 
Avoid checking e-mail during the meeting. If you catch yourself multitasking, refocus and be responsible for your full 
participation.
• 
Turn off cell phones and other electronic devices that are not needed for the conference call.
• 
Construct an agenda that encourages participant input. Assume that participants will start to get distracted after 10 or 
15 minutes, or after three presentation slides, then design into your agenda ways to engage participants (with ques­
tions, online idea generation, visualization exercises, etc.) more frequently than you might in a face-to-face session. 
Test the technology an hour before the meeting.
• 
Remind participants to log in to webinar software first, then call in to the meeting or utilize the calling feature to have 
the system place a call directly to the participant. This will associate the phone line to the individual’s name.
During the Webinar:
• 
Try to call in or log on a few minutes early to ensure that the technology is properly set up and working.
• 
Start the session with a quick check-in so that everyone attending knows who else is there and that the connections are 
adequate.
• 
Unless this is a small meeting where all participants are well acquainted, ask participants to identify themselves every 
time they talk.
• 
Make the session visible: share PowerPoints or other documents.
• 
Always keep in mind the fact that you will not have the benefit of seeing the attendees. If there are questions or 
concerns about an item, you will need to ask questions or create a process that gets to them without relying on facial 
expressions or body language.
• 
Speak and instruct others to speak as clearly and precisely as possible.
• 
Use pauses and questions to verify your understanding of what the participant is saying, as well as their understanding 
of what you are saying.

A Guide to Effective Facilitation  •  23
• 
Recap and summarize often.
• 
Use electronic tools only as necessary and not because they are fun to play with.
• 
Refer to slide number or page number if you are using a previously sent presentation.
• 
Change the way you ask for feedback. Ask “What questions do you have?” instead of “Are there any questions?” Watch 
out for questions like, “Does everyone agree?” Remote attendees can’t answer easily without stepping over each other’s 
responses. Webinar software often includes polling features that can help you solicit feedback.
• 
Encourage participants to utilize the chat feature. Conduct a quick demonstration so that participants are familiar with 
how to use it.
Post-Webinar:
• 
Post follow-up materials, meeting minutes and any other documents discussed during the meeting in a location for all 
participants to access them, or send them out via email.
• 
Some webinar tools allow you save a recording of the meeting for later playback, should you choose to do so.
• 
Be sure that all participates have access to follow-up materials before leaving the call. If possible, conduct a quick 
demonstration of the site so that participants know where to find documents, as well as how to use various features of 
the site.
• 
Wrap-up by expressing your appreciation to participants, as well as providing information on when they will receive 
training documentation or follow-up.
