She was presenting on webinars and made it look easy and engaging. I could tell a  lot of preparation and experience had gone into her session. Impressed with her techniques for making webinar instruction and learning  interactive, I introduced myself after class. Since then, we’ve had many conversations  and I appreciate the insight and skill she has in making virtual learning become more  alive. Out of these conversations came a foundation of trust and respect, and that led  us to collaborate on SCORE for Webinars, which will come out in early 2014.  Cindy is such a valuable asset to the training industry, and I really value the time I  spend working with her. She is a tremendous sounding board for ideas and has provided  so much valuable guidance for me as a trainer, an author, and a company CEO. In The Virtual Training Guidebook, Cindy provides a comprehensive guide to  live online learning in an easy-to-follow, step-by-step format. The book begins with  simple definitions and ends with how to measure online training effectiveness as  well as a discussion on future trends. However, I feel this book is such an excellent resource because, while detailing  her process for virtual training, Cindy stays true to the most important aspect— interaction and engagement in the learning process. Throughout her work, she  emphasizes the need to facilitate instruction and ensure participants are actively  engaged in their learning.  After reading this book, I believe you will feel more comfortable and confident  in handling the technical and technological aspects of virtual training. Becky Pike Pluth CEO of The Bob Pike Group Author of Webinars with WOW Factor vii Acknowledgments A special thanks to the many business and training professionals who willingly  shared their advice and stories about their experience with virtual training: Becky  Pike Pluth, Cheryl Scanlan, Dan Gallagher, Danielle Buscher, Darlene Chris­ topher, David Smith, Erin Laughlin, Jeff Robinson, Jennifer Newton, Jill Kennedy,  Jim Wilcox, John Hall, Justin Patton, Kassy LaBorie, Ken Hubbell, Lisa Brodeth  Carrick, Lorna Matty, Lucy Brown, Matt Murdoch, Peggy Page, Stephan Girard,  Tara Welsh, Tracy Stanfield, Treion Muller, Trish Carr, and Wendy Gates Corbett,  along with a few who chose to remain anonymous (you know who you are!). I am  grateful to each one of them for their willingness to offer wisdom and their lessons  learned. Their contributions have enriched this book. Thank you.   I’m also extremely grateful to Wendy Gates Corbett for all of the time and effort  she spent reading early versions of the manuscript and for sharing her thoughts and  suggestions on the content. Her insights were invaluable and made this book much  better than it would have been otherwise.  Thank you also to Justin Brusino and Ashley McDonald at ASTD Press for  their enormous patience during the lengthy book writing process. Their encour­ agement and advice carried this book through from concept to completion. Finally, I dedicate this book to my best friend and husband, Bobby Huggett, who  endured hearing me type on the keyboard for hours on end over many nights and  weekends. Without his love and support this book would never have been written.  Cindy Huggett Psalm 115:1  October 2013 9 Chapter 2 Get Ready In this chapter, you will learn four things you should do to get ready  for a virtual training implementation: •	 Ask yourself, “What’s your end goal?” •	 Define virtual training for your organization. •	 Get the right people involved. •	 Build an implementation plan. Whether you want to have an extensive virtual training course curriculum that will  require months of planning or only want to have one single online session, an imple­ mentation plan will help you get ready to use virtual training in your organization. The first task in any implementation is to plan for success. As well-known author  Stephen Covey once wrote, “Begin with the end in mind” (1989). The same thought  is true for a virtual training implementation. Begin by thinking about the end goal.  Discover Your End Goal  The planning journey will start with your first step, which should be to ask yourself  questions such as: What’s our goal for this training program? What are we trying to  accomplish? What do we want to be different as a result of it? Do we need participants  to be more knowledgeable about a topic? Do we want them to behave differently?  Take action on something? How will our organization change or improve as a result?  What’s the best way to achieve these goals? How specifically would virtual training  help achieve these outcomes?  By answering these questions, you define your vision of virtual training success.  You determine the purpose of your initiative and articulate your desired end result.  By intentionally setting goals, you can increase your likelihood of achieving them.  These questions can also help you determine if virtual training is the appropriate  solution for your situation. Virtual training is not the answer just because everyone  else is doing it or because it’s a shiny object that captures your passing interest.  Chapter 2 10 It may surprise you to hear that virtual training may not be the right solution  for your organization. If by answering these questions, you realize that you’re imple­ menting virtual training just because you have heard it’s a cheaper alternative to  traditional training, or just because your employees are dispersed throughout the  globe, or just because a competitor is doing it, then those are not the right reasons.  All of these might be contributing factors to your reasons for wanting to implement  virtual training. But the best reason to implement virtual training is that it will be  the best solution to meet your organization’s needs.  When done well, virtual training can transfer knowledge, increase productivity,  help you gain competitive advantage, and positively affect business results. Virtual  training can help you reach a global audience. It can reduce travel costs for training  budgets. It can create opportunities for dispersed learners to interact with each other  and a facilitator. And it can help provide training to participants who may otherwise  not have access to instructor-led learning.  The point is that you should be clear about the reasons for using virtual training  implementation. By beginning with the end, you can define what success will look  like for your organization. “Be really intentional about choosing {virtual training} as a modality. You both  gain and give up. We’ve never promised that virtual training is the same learning  experience as face-to-face training, but with a team located in cities around the  world it’s the most efficient way to deliver a consistent learning experience.” —Dan Gallagher, Vice President of Learning at Comcast; and author, The Self-Aware Leader (ASTD, 2012)  Let’s say, for example, your organization decides to decrease administrative costs  worldwide by switching to a new online expense reporting system. End users need  to learn how to use this new system in order for the costs savings to be realized. After  looking at travel costs, participant locations, and trainer time, you determine that  live online sessions will be the best way to both demonstrate and answer questions  about the new features. You realize that virtual training will help you reach your  geographically dispersed audience. And you believe the software skills content is  suited to a virtual method.  Get Ready 11 So you might define the goals and objectives for this initiative by factoring in  the organization’s aim to decrease administrative costs and determining what end  users specifically need to know and do with the new system features. These goals will  help you define the learning objectives. But more importantly, they will help you  design and deliver the appropriate type of virtual training for this initiative. What type of virtual training will you deliver? That takes us to the next step in  getting ready. Define Virtual Training  One of the other most important things to do near the start of your journey is to  define what your organization means by “virtual training.” Virtual training conjures up a myriad of definitions. While it probably means  only one thing to you, it is certain to have a different meaning to someone else. You  might think virtual training is any type of online course, while the person sitting  next to you thinks virtual training is self-paced asynchronous learning. And the  person down the hall might think virtual training is a webcast that has one presenter  and hundreds of audience participants. Due to these disparate definitions, it makes  sense to start by defining what you and your organization will mean when you say  “virtual training.”  No one is to blame that we have so many meanings of virtual training. If you  look to how we use the term virtual in everyday life, the same pattern emerges. We  talk about virtual reality, virtual teams, virtual wallets, virtual meetings, and virtual  presentations, just to name a few. A cursory web search of the word “virtual” turns  up over 1.2 billion hits. The lexicon of virtual training follows suit. So what is virtual training? The definition I typically use is: a highly interactive synchronous online instructor-led training class, with defined  learning objectives, with participants who are individually connected from geograph­ ically dispersed locations, using a web-based classroom platform. We’ll peel apart that definition in a moment, but first, let’s talk about what else  virtual training could be. To some, virtual training is any type of training delivered online. This definition  would include asynchronous self-paced e-learning, as well as synchronous online  classes. In this case, virtual training is considered to be synonymous with online  learning. If it happens on the web, either alone or together with another person,  then it would fit into their definition.  Chapter 2 12 To others, virtual training encompasses any type of knowledge transfer that  happens to be in an online environment. This definition includes webcasts, webinars,  and online presentations. If any type of information is shared using a web confer­ encing platform, then it might be considered virtual training. And still to others, virtual training refers to video conferencing or any type of  telecommunication. A group of learners could be huddled together in a conference  room in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, while another group could be together in Seattle,  Washington, and a third group could be in Paris, France. They could be using their  company’s official video camera setup installed in each room, or a more informal  online video sharing software. Just because participants are dispersed in multiple  locations, some would consider this style of video conferencing to be virtual training. The list of examples could go on. There are as many definitions of virtual  training as there are types of training classes—which is why you need to establish  up front what you mean by virtual training, and get everyone involved on the  same page.  You might decide to use more than one type of virtual training in your organi­ zation. In fact, you probably will. Yet for each session, you should define exactly  what your goal will be, and what method (that is, type of virtual training) you will  use to get there.  I can’t stress enough: Set the appropriate expectations with everyone involved.  Be intentional about your goals for each virtual session and ensure that everyone is  aware of those intentions. The success of your virtual training implementation will  depend upon it. “It’s really important to call things by the right name and set those expectations.  What you call something really influences the design and sets the stakeholders  expectations.”  —Peggy Page, Design Group Manager, TD Bank Let’s return to dissecting my definition of virtual training. It’s one of the most  common descriptions used. To remind you, the definition is: a highly interactive  synchronous online instructor-led training class, with defined learning objectives, with  Get Ready 13 participants who are individually connected from geographically dispersed locations,  using a web-based classroom platform. In other words, virtual training is (or has): •	 Highly interactive—participants engage frequently, at least every few  minutes, with the facilitator, with the learning content, and with the  virtual classroom tools. •	 Synchronous—participants meet together at the same time. Sometimes  referred to as “live” or in the case of virtual training, live online. •	 Instructor-led—facilitated by a professional trainer or instructor. •	 Defined learning objectives—clearly stated performance expectations  that learners will be able to achieve as a result of actively participating  in the session. •	 Geographically dispersed participants—learners are distributed and apart  from one another. Moreover, each participant joins from his own device  and has his own audio/telephone connection. •	 Web-based classroom platform—a software program used for training that  allows for online screen and file sharing, and has participant interaction  tools such as polling, chatting, and annotating.  So a typical virtual training class might meet on a Thursday at 10 a.m., last  90 minutes, and have 18 participants from various locations around the country.  The group would meet online using a synchronous tool, such as Adobe Connect  or Citrix GoToTraining. The class would be led by a facilitator, and would result in  the participants learning a new skill that could be immediately applied to their jobs. Of course, your virtual training might not look like the one described above. You  might have an alternate set of standards for timing, or number of participants, or even  the learning outcomes. What’s most important is that you define what your organi­ zation means by virtual training, and that everyone involved is on the same page. Other Types of Live Online Sessions  Since so many of the tips found in this book can be applied to the various types of  synchronous online sessions, let’s also expand upon those common definitions.  Chapter 2 14 What Does a Virtual Training Class Look Like? In case you are brand new to virtual training, here is an illustration,  adapted from my first book Virtual Training Basics.  Michelle is a trainer for a large telecommunications company. She’s  located in Cincinnati, Ohio and will be facilitating a 60-minute virtual class  on Thursday morning at 11 a.m. Eastern time. About a week prior to the  training date, she sends an email message with directions and logistics  to her participants. About an hour prior to the start time, she sits at her  office desk, logs into the virtual classroom software, and gets ready for  the event. She uploads slides, opens the first polling question, and  prepares the virtual whiteboard. She completes all of her pre-class  preparation and waits for everyone to arrive.  Around  a.m. Eastern time on Thursday, the participants start entering  the classroom. They do this from the comfort of their own respective  offices: sitting at their own desks, opening up their Internet browsers,  and clicking on the link from Michelle’s email message.  One participant—Moira—is in her office in Dallas, Texas. She clicks on the  link and goes straight to the login page. She types in her name and email  address, and waits for the classroom software to load on her screen. Once  connected, she sees the conference call number on screen, picks up her  phone, and dials in, using her unique attendee ID displayed on screen.  Moira hears Michelle’s voice on the line, and says hello to greet her. The  other participants follow the same steps to join the class.  The participants are able to see what Michelle has prepared for them on  the screen. They see the names of the other attendees, the slides, a chat  window, and the first polling question.  The participants communicate with each other verbally and online  through frequent activities such as typing in the chat window, responding  to polls, and writing on the whiteboard. At one point, Michelle assigns the  participants into virtual breakout groups, and Moira is able to talk privately  with her class partner Julie. They practice one of the new skills before  returning to the large group for a debrief discussion.  By 12 p.m., class finishes, and Michelle asks everyone to complete  a follow-up assignment to apply what they’ve just learned. Get Ready 15 Webcast  A webcast primarily disseminates information from a speaker to a large audience. A  speaker uses slides to present and share information. Sometimes a webcast includes  multiple speakers or a panel of experts. And usually a webcast has a large audience,  anywhere from a few dozen to a few thousand attendees. A webcast is solely one-way communication from a presenter to attendees. Think  about a traditional television newscast—with a news anchor reading from a script,  using visual aids to illustrate stories, and interacting with other news presenters. A  traditional newscast has little to no interaction with the audience, which is also true  of a webcast. If your organization were to pull a large audience together for a scripted town  hall meeting, with presentations on the company strategy and only a short time  for Q&A at the end, then this type of meeting—if held online—could be called  a webcast. Webinar  In its traditional definition, a webinar is an online seminar. Like a webcast, a  webinar is also primarily one-way communication from a presenter to attendees.  However, webinars often employ interactive techniques such as polling, chatting, or  whiteboard annotating. If you think about how television newscasts have evolved  over time, many modern news programs now incorporate audience interaction  through social media and other techniques. For example, a reporter might respond  to viewers’ on-air questions or invite listeners to vote online and then report on the  collected results.  It’s the same with a webinar. The information shared is mostly one-way from  speaker to audience. The speaker(s) use slides to present, while periodically involving  attendees through polls and other brief interactions. While some webinars can be  highly interactive, most are not. You might think of a webinar like a university class, with an expert professor  behind a podium and hundreds of students sitting in an auditorium. The class will  have some interactivity through questions-and-answers, assignments, and quizzes.  But the large class size limits the type and frequency of interaction available. If your  organization’s human resources department decided to hold informational sessions  about a new company travel portal, and throughout the event they offered several  Chapter 2 16 opportunities for discussion and dialog, then this type of session—if held online— could be called a webinar. The term webinar is so popular that many people believe it is synonymous  with virtual training. It’s increasingly common for organizations to call their virtual  training sessions a webinar. Many popular speakers, authors, and trainers interchange  the word webinar for virtual training. I’ve even done it myself on numerous occasions. The intent behind calling virtual training a webinar is good—yet the effect  can potentially create challenges for several reasons. First, participants who have  attended passive webinars may expect to do the same in a virtual training class named  a webinar. Second, presenters may assume the session should be lecture-based, and  design and deliver the session accordingly. Third, administrators may unknowingly  set up the event using a meeting platform instead of a training platform, which  can affect the available features. When these expectations are mismatched—your  intent is an interactive virtual training class but the result is a passive presentation— then there is higher risk for failure. Therefore, if you choose to call your sessions a  webinar, as many organizations do, be prepared to climb any extra communication  hurdles that may be required for success.  Attend a Free Webinar! A popular current trend is a specialized online session: the marketing  webinar. Organizations use these marketing events to share information  about their products and services to hundreds or even thousands of  people. Organizations contract with thought leaders who speak on a  subject, and invite everyone in their target market to this free event.  Attendees register for a session so they can hear from the expert speaker.  Organizations use this registration data so they can capture interest and  follow up with participants. At some point during the session, a sponsor’s  commercial is usually shared with attendees. The positive trade-off is obvious—attendees learn something for free,   while organizations capture valuable marketing data, and sponsors  generate advertising. Get Ready 17 Video Conference  When participants are huddled together in a conference room using a video camera  and viewing a screen that shows other groups huddled around other conference  tables with the same setup, it would be called a video conference. Some would call  it a virtual meeting. If this setup is used for learning, then it could be called remote  training or distance learning.  Video conferencing systems used to be found only in sophisticated technology- enriched office meeting rooms; however, with new technologies and decreased costs,  it’s becoming more common for this same setup to substitute for virtual training.  If participants are together, and can see each other via video conference, then  a trainer could join in and with the right design, facilitate a training class. It’s  synchronous, online, instructor-led, and has geographically dispersed participants.  If you replace the video camera with a web conferencing platform then some would  call it virtual training. But unfortunately, that’s where defining this type of setup as  virtual training can become confusing. Most web conferencing platforms are designed for one person to use one  computer. When a group of participants are sharing the same connection to a virtual  training class, they have to combine their responses when responding to a poll, and  take turns typing in the chat window. It’s a different experience than each person  connecting on their own.  The extra challenge is when you try to combine virtual training (one person  with one computer) with video conferencing (groups sharing one connection in  a conference room). This setup creates stress on the design because activities have  to be designed in multiple ways for them to work. Single participants feel even  Webcast, Webinar, or Virtual Training? The first main difference between a webcast, a webinar, and a virtual  training class is the amount of participant interactivity in each one.  Webcasts typically have the least amount of interaction, followed by  webinars, then virtual training classes. The second main difference is the  number of participants. Webcasts tend to be the largest, then webinars,  followed by virtual training classes. There is not a simple black-and-white  calculation that will tell you which is which; instead it’s more like shades  of grey on a continuum. Chapter 2 18 more alone when they hear a room full of active learners, and the grouped together  learners usually miss out on the platform’s interactive features since they are not  touching the keyboard.  If video conferencing is your definition of virtual training, then design, deliver,  and implement for that type of training. It’s not a good idea to mix and match the  two methods in the same class. “The worst mistake I have seen is treating a virtual webinar/training just like  a meeting.” —Jill Kennedy, Learning & Development Specialist, Ally Financial Blended Learning  When multiple delivery methods, including virtual events, are thoughtfully combined  together into a training curriculum, the result is blended learning. Allison Rossett  and Rebecca Vaughan Frazee define blended learning this way: “Blended learning  integrates seemingly opposite approaches, such as formal and informal learning,  face-to-face and online experiences, directed paths and reliance on self-direction,  and digital references and collegial connections, in order to achieve individual and  organizational goals” (Rosett and Frazee, 2006). It’s typical to find a combination of asynchronous self-paced activities and  synchronous live instructor-led events in blended learning. For example, a learner  in a blended interpersonal skills curriculum might receive instructions to complete  a self-paced assignment, then attend two live virtual training events with another  self-paced assignment in-between. Each of these components in the blended learning  program is an important piece to the overall learning outcome. Learners need to  complete all components to realize full results. Blended learning is mentioned in this book because it’s so common to find  live online virtual training events as a significant component of a blended learning  curriculum. You can apply the common phrase—learning is a process, not an event— by including virtual training in a blend. Stringing together multiple virtual events  in a series allows for more flexible learning implementations. Instead of a single  six-hour training session, the curriculum could be four 90-minute sessions spread  Get Ready 19 out over time. It’s also an opportunity for participants to learn something on their  own and then meet together with a facilitator and other learners for skill practice. For example, last year I designed a blended communication skills training  program for one of my clients. The participants began by attending a virtual kickoff  session to meet one another and learn about what to expect in the curriculum. They  also received a short, self-paced assignment to help prepare themselves for the  learning topics. Two weeks later, they met for an in-person workshop to learn and  practice fundamental skills, again receiving an assignment at the end. Over the next  four weeks, the participants met for two virtual training classes with application  assignments in-between. The entire blended curriculum was approximately 24  hours of training time (including the assignments), and each component contributed  to the learning outcomes. Our Definition of Virtual Training From this point forward, this book will refer to virtual training using my definition  expressed above: a highly interactive synchronous online instructor-led training class,  with defined learning objectives, with participants who are individually connected from  geographically dispersed locations, using a web-based classroom platform. However,  regardless of what your organization implements—virtual training, webcasts,  webinars, video conferencing, or blended learning—the general principles outlined  in this book will help you have a more successful online initiative.  What About a MOOC? MOOC stands for “massive open online course.” A MOOC is typically  offered by colleges and universities as a way to open up education to  all. Anyone with an Internet connection can sign up for a MOOC and  participate in an online class, alongside traditional university students. While MOOCs are currently popular, they are largely asynchronous,  blended learning curriculums. Only if the MOOC instructor offered an  interactive, live online segment would that piece of the course fall under  our definition of virtual training. Chapter 2 20 Get the Right People Involved  Once you have set forth your goals for virtual training and defined what you mean  by it, get the right people involved with your virtual training initiative. Successful  virtual training depends upon many parts of an organization. So getting the right  people involved from the start will increase your chances of success.  There are at least three reasons for getting the right people involved at the start  of your virtual training initiative. First, to gain their support. Second, to gain their  input. Third, to make use of their available resources—both tangible (hardware,  technology, funding) and intangible (wisdom, knowledge, experience). How do you know who to include in these initial conversations? In smaller  organizations, the answer will probably be obvious. In larger organizations, the  answer will mean doing your homework and finding out who the stakeholders are  for each part of your virtual training initiative. Either way, it’s better to invite more  input than needed than to keep the information to yourself and potentially miss a  key player. Frequently Asked Questions About Virtual Training Q: How long should a live online session be?  A: Virtual training classes tend to be shorter than their in-person classroom  counterparts. A typical virtual session is 60 to 120 minutes in length. If you  have more content than that length of time allows, consider chunking  the content into smaller parts. It would be better to have three 90-minute  virtual classes than to have a 4.5 hour continuous session. However, if  you need to have a lengthy virtual class, be sure to take regular breaks  throughout! We’ll talk more about virtual class design in chapter 4. Q: What about asynchronous e-learning? Isn’t that considered  virtual training? A: In the sense that self-paced asynchronous e-learning can occur  online, then some might consider it to be virtual training. However, it’s  most common to distinguish virtual training as synchronous, or live online,  training. So this book follows that conventional format. Get Ready 21 “My advice? Involve everyone in the organization up front. Different teams have  different roles to play in the virtual training initiative.”  —Danielle Buscher, Director of Global Learning, Marriott International The typical roles involved with a virtual training rollout are listed below. Note  that these may not be job titles, per se, but are job functions that carry out respon­ sibilities that affect the success of virtual training. Also, in some organizations,  one person may play more than one role. For example, the instructor who delivers  virtual training may also have been the person who designs it. Or the facilitator and  the administrator might be the same person. The smaller the organization, the more  likely it is to have one person spanning multiple roles. And on the flip side, there  may be more than one person for each function, such as an IT representative for  each location. •	 Content owners: Sometimes referred to as a subject matter expert (SME),  this person has deep knowledge of the training topic. They might be an  employee in the field, or a manager with responsibility for the subject  matter. They can help design the training and ensure topic relevancy. •	 Designers: Instructional designers create the training. This role might  include graphic designers as well as workplace learning professionals who  specialize in adult learning methodologies and instructional technology. •	 Facilitators: Also called trainers or instructors, this is the person in “front”  of the class who delivers the virtual training sessions.  •	 Producers: These are the technical experts who assist a facilitator during  a live online session. Some producers specialize in technology-only assis­ tance (working with participants who need help connecting), while other  producers co-facilitate sessions along with the trainer. In some cases, a  producer may be called a host or session moderator. •	 Coordinators: As the administrative person who handles logistical details  of virtual training events, this person might administer the organization’s  LMS (learning management system), as well as communicate with partici­ pants before and after an event. Chapter 2 22 •	 Technicians: Usually called IT (information technology) or IS  (information services), this role owns the technology—both hardware  and software—needed for virtual training success.  •	 Participants: They are otherwise known as learners or in some cases,  program attendees. Since they are the “customer” or “end user” of the  virtual training initiative, consider including a representative sample  in your initial planning stages.  •	 Managers: As the participants’ managers, they need to support the full  participation of their employees. This group’s buy-in is critical to success  because they will allow participants time to attend training, as well as  reinforce the skills learned. •	 Resource Owners: These stakeholders control resources needed for  creating, designing, delivering, and implementing virtual training. This  group could be training management, who directs the training function  and its associated resources. Or it could be general management who  controls budget and other needed resources.  •	 Executive Sponsor: The senior executive is the individual who can  support and champion the virtual training initiative at the highest levels  of the organization. We will explore many of these roles in more detail in other places in this book.  For now, it’s most important to realize that each one can contribute to the success of  your virtual training initiative. Involve them in the earliest stages. “Our project team included human resources, IT, training design and development,  and all of the subject matter experts for each part of the curriculum.” —Erin Laughlin, Senior Director Global Learning Delivery,  Marriott International Once you have invited the right people to the table for discussion, have an open  dialogue with each about what it will take for success from their perspective. This  dialogue could be one-on-one conversations, or it could be a cross-functional project  Get Ready 23 team discussion. The communication format is not as important as actually having  communication with key players.  In your communication with these stakeholders, start by sharing the answers  you already uncovered: what is the end goal of this initiative and how you define  virtual training. Depending on the exact timing of these conversations and your  organization’s unique situation, you might even gain their input to these questions. After sharing the overarching goals, select the appropriate discussion questions  from this list below: m m What suggestions or recommendations do you have? m m What questions or concerns do you have? m m From your view, what will it take to be successful? m m What resources do you need for your part of the initiative? What resources   can you contribute? m m Who else should be involved with this initiative? m m Will I have your support? If you form a cross-functional team, follow standard project management  processes for your implementation. Hold a kickoff meeting, create a project charter,  and clearly define each person’s role in the project. Which Comes First?  Should you start with determining your goals and defining what you mean  by virtual training, and then get the right people involved? Or should you  get the right people involved first, so that they can help you establish  goals and define virtual training? The answer…it depends. There’s not a  right or wrong answer. What’s most important is that you actually do all   of these things. Chapter 2 24 Build a Plan  The fourth step to getting ready is to build an implementation plan. It’s possible  that when you gather stakeholders to discuss the plan, you may need to step back  and start with a business case—just to gain support for the initiative. However,  if you are fortunate enough to already have financial and resource support, that’s  fantastic! You could still benefit from working through the suggestions in this step  even without needing to follow through on them, to help crystallize your training  implementation plans. On the other hand, if you do need to build a business case— to gain support for the program or to negotiate for resources—use the momentum  created so far to move forward with your proposal.  If you need to build a business case for virtual training, start with your objec­ tives. Articulate who will benefit from the initiative, and exactly how they will  benefit. Spell out the anticipated positive impact to the organization. Identify both  the costs and the potential return-on-investment.  A typical business case includes the following items: •	 overview of the business problem to solve •	 recommended solution to the problem •	 benefits of the recommended solution •	 resources needed, including cost and financial details •	 expected results to be realized. The business case for virtual training should be presented to whoever controls  resources needed and has the authority to share those resources. All or some of  the business case might also be presented to key stakeholders to help them see the  benefits of virtual training. Wendy Gates Corbett, a global training director, created a business case to  establish virtual training as a method to help her company’s global customer base  learn about their software products. Her proposal to her executive team included  facts about the potential for virtual training, suggested solutions for realizing that  potential, and the resources they would need. She established the benefits and  outlined the expected return on their investment. Spelling out these details gave her  the momentum and approval needed to launch the plan for virtual training. Get Ready 25 Calculating the Costs of Virtual Training  You may be part of an organization that chooses virtual training to save costs. For  example, travel budgets have been slashed and flying to deliver or attend in-person  training is no longer allowed. In this case, a traditional business case is probably not  needed because key stakeholders gave instructions to reduce funding as opposed to  granting it.  What is needed in this scenario is a business case that explicitly outlines the true  costs of effective virtual training. Since the expectation would be to reduce or even  eliminate funding, you will need a solid business case to clearly illustrate the costs  of implementing virtual training. Virtual training is perceived to be less expensive  than traditional in-person training; however, that perception is not always reality. Virtual training does reduce travel expenses when learners are able to stay at  their desks instead of hop on a plane or drive to a training location. However, virtual  training includes costs that did not exist for in-person training. These costs could  Building a Business Case at the World Bank Group To build the business case for virtual training at the World Bank Group,  Learning Officer Darlene Christopher wisely connected virtual training  to an important corporate initiative. At that time, her organization was  looking to reduce its carbon footprint to create a more sustainable  environment. Darlene calculated the carbon emissions savings that would  be realized by conducting virtual training instead of in-person training.  She converted the emissions savings into tangible results (for example,  “By hosting one virtual session we will avoid 44 tons of carbon emissions,  which is equivalent to recycling 13.8 tons of waste or growing 1024 trees  for 10 years”). The excitement over the potential for virtual training literally  grew out of this message, which was tied to helping the business achieve  its goals. Darlene’s advice to others is to start small. Find a willing stakeholder or two  within your organization who will support a simple virtual training initiative.  Get an early win, and then think about what story you can tell from that  experience. By starting small, you can get others interested and excited  about the initiative, and then build traction from there. Think about what  corporate initiative you could tie into for support, and how virtual training  can help your organization achieve its goals. Chapter 2 26 include new telephone headsets for all participants, increased administrative fees for  the additional logistics, significant conference calling charges, additional design time,  and the cost of two facilitators (or a facilitator and a producer) for each virtual event. Use the following chart to compare how your costs may change as a result of  using virtual training:  Table 2-1 The Costs of Virtual Training Costs Increase or Decrease (as compared to  traditional classroom  training) Virtual classroom software platform licenses Increase Integrated telephone/conference call subscription  and per-event costs (if not using VoIP) Increase Computer hardware needs, such as hands-free  telephone headsets for participants Increase Printing costs of classroom materials Decrease Printing costs for learners  (who are often asked to print their own materials) Increase Two facilitators, or a facilitator and a producer, for  each virtual event (See chapter 5 for more information  about this item) Increase A second laptop for facilitators who should be logged  into the platform twice (once as a presenter and once  as a participant) Increase Training for staff (designers and facilitators) who need  to learn the new virtual classroom software platform  and how to design/deliver virtual training Increase Design and development time of the  training curriculum1 Increase Travel fees for both participants and facilitators Decrease Classroom materials that no longer need to be  purchased (i.e., chart paper, markers, etc.) Decrease Productivity for participants who do not have to leave  their desks to attend training in another location Increase 1.	According to research by Karl Kapp and Robin Defelice, it takes on average 43 hours of development time to  create one hour of instructor-led training, and it takes approximately 49 hours of development time to create  one hour of interactive virtual training.

Get Ready 27 “We took a two-day performance management course and converted it into a  blended learning program. The new converted program included six virtual  sessions along with self-paced assignments. This new solution created efficiency for  learners; however, it increased the administrative work required for the trainer  and the program manager. Don’t assume that because you’re saving on airfare that  virtual training will be less expensive. While you save on learner expenses, you often  increase your design, delivery, and administrative costs.” —Dan Gallagher, Vice President of Learning at Comcast;  and author, The Self-Aware Leader (ASTD, 2012) By fully considering the true costs of virtual training in your organization, you  can 1) request appropriate funding in your business case, and 2) set yourself up for  success in your initiative. Creating an Implementation Plan  Once you have support and resources to move forward with virtual training, the  next step is to create an implementation plan. This project plan will detail your  strategy for rolling out virtual training in your organization. To create it, you’ll need  input from key stakeholders, as well as timelines and deliverables for each step of  the process.  The complexity of your implementation plan will match the complexity of  your project. The strategy and detail needed to establish a comprehensive virtual  training curriculum will differ from the amount of detail needed to plan a one-time  virtual class. Regardless of the size of your virtual training initiative, a typical implemen­ tation plan will include considerations for design, delivery, and administration. We  will explore each of these topics starting with the next chapter. Chapter 2 28 One Organization’s Story Way of Life Coaching, LLC based in Raleigh, North Carolina, offers an  eight-month group coaching course called “Promised Land Living.”  Founder Cheryl Scanlan’s vision was to expand the reach of this program  beyond the local community. She wanted to make the curriculum  available to anyone regardless of their geographic location. After careful consideration of various options, Cheryl decided to convert  the program to an all-virtual curriculum. Together with her team she  started planning what it would take to make it happen. They worked  together for months as they planned out the implementation strategy. They: •	 budgeted resources for the new delivery methodology •	 redesigned the content for virtual delivery •	 involved subject matter experts and stakeholders for advice and input •	 researched and selected a virtual training platform •	 created a marketing plan to communicate the new program format •	 worked with participants and facilitators to help them get comfortable  with virtual training. Cheryl’s advice to other organizations who are considering the move  to virtual? “Get familiar with the virtual training platform, and how often  the vendor makes updates to it. Be sure you test drive the platform  after upgrades to make sure there are no surprises. I would also highly  recommend that you have a producer for every virtual class so that you  can be about the business of delivering your material. That made all the  difference for us and our clients!” Get Ready 29 In Summary: Key Points From Chapter 2  •	 Determine if virtual training is the right training solution for  your organization. •	 Define what you mean by virtual training and ensure everyone  in your organization shares that same definition. •	 Get the right people involved in your virtual training, as close to  the project start time as possible.  •	 If needed, create a business case to secure enough resources  for your virtual training plan.  Chapter 2 30  Checklist 2-1 Is Virtual Training the Right Solution? To help determine if virtual training is the correct solution to use for your organi­ zation, consider the following questions:  m m Are the participants centrally located or dispersed? If your organization  is not going to save on travel expenses because everyone is in the same  location, then consider sticking with in-person training. It may be just as fast  for them to walk down the hallway to your training room as it would be for  them to log in to a virtual classroom. m m What technology barriers affect success? Participants need to have the  appropriate technology available to them. The exact technology needed  will vary depending upon the virtual software program used; however, a  typical technology setup requires a high-speed Internet connection, a  sound card and speakers to hear streaming media, and administrative  privileges to install software. Our next chapter addresses technology factors. m m Do you have qualified trainers and producers to facilitate the virtual training  event? Classroom trainers need a new skill set to effectively deliver virtual  training. They need to be comfortable with technology, able to multitask  well, and know how to engage participants who they can’t see. These  skills come with training and practice; however, this trainer preparation  time should be factored into the decision. In addition, a virtual training  event will go much smoother with producer involved with the facilitation.  The producer is a second person who assists the trainer with technology,  troubleshooting, and running the virtual event. They help create a seamless  experience for participants. We will consider trainer and producer qualifica­ tions in chapter 5. m m Will every participant have an appropriate learning environment?  Participants need to have their own individual computer connection and  telephone line to attend the virtual event. They should be in a quiet area  conducive to learning. If they are in an open space or cubicle environment,  they will need headphones or another way to tune out external noise.  Chapter 6 provides a comprehensive look at how to set up participants  for effective online learning environments. m m Who will administer the logistical details for the training program? The online  environment creates a long list of logistics that need to be executed for a  successful class. This includes creating the virtual classroom event(s) within  the software’s administrative tools, getting links and passwords to everyone  who needs them, distributing handouts and other class materials to partic­ ipants, and helping participants troubleshoot technical problems prior to  class. Chapter 7 covers all of the administrative details that will be needed  for your initiative. m m Do all participants speak the same language? Virtual training can be an  excellent way to provide training to an international population, as long  as language barriers do not get in the way. Note that chapter 8 focuses  on other global considerations. Get Ready 31  Worksheet 2-1 Goal Setting What’s our goal for this training program?
