Specify the facilitation topic or goal to the group (if possible, do this step as pre-work  before the next meeting).  2.  Ask for free-for-all generation of ideas from among members of the group.   3.  List all the ideas on a flipchart, holding back any reactions and/or discussion from any  members of the group until all ideas are collected.  (Members might ask a quick question  about an idea, but only to understand the meaning of the idea, not to make a decision  about the idea.)  Optional:  4.  Combine the ideas into common categories.  This can be done by using the discussion,  voting (ranking or rating) and/or consensus techniques.    5.  Select the most preferred categories and/or ideas.  This can be done by using the  discussion, voting (ranking or rating) and/or consensus techniques.    Consensus Technique  Often, there is confusion around the term consensus.  Consensus means that every member of the  group can live with the group’s final decision.  It does not mean that every member completely  agrees with the decision.  Consensus is often the means by which highly participative groups  members reach their decisions, especially if they favor a highly egalitarian approach to decision  making.    There are several approaches to the technique of reaching consensus.  One quick approach to  consensus is to just ask for a quick conclusion from the group by 1) suggesting a specific answer  to the decision that must be made by the group and 2) asking if everyone in the group can live  with that suggestion.  Although that approach might save a lot of time, it certainly does not  support the kind of discussions that generate ownership and learning among group members.   Therefore, planners might consider the following, more thoughtful approach to reaching  consensus.    Before Meeting  Members receive information that:  1.  Clarifies the decision to be made.    It is often best if the decision is written in the form of a “yes/no” question or a choice  from among alternatives, for example, “Should we approve ___?”  or “Should we hire  ____?”.  2.  Is sufficient for each member to come to some conclusion on his or her own.        12 Common Techniques in Facilitating Groups  Adapted from  Field Guide to Nonprofit Strategic Planning and Facilitation  © Authenticity Consulting, LLC    ®    www.authenticityconsulting.com    ®    800.971.2250    ®     of 10  Ground Rules During Consensus Activities  The facilitator explains ground rules to other members of the group, for example:    1.  Members do not interrupt each other.  2.  Members can disagree with each other.  3.  Members do not engage in side discussions.  4.  Silence is considered agreement with the decision to be made.  5.  If decision is reached by consensus, then all members act as a united front to support  decision.  Consensus Process in Meeting  The facilitator guides the procedure.   1.  The facilitator specifies a deadline by which to reach consensus in the meeting.  2.  In a roundtable fashion, each member:   a) Gets equal time to voice his or her preferences and reasons in regard to the question.  b) Focuses perspectives on what is doable  c) Does not mention other members’ names  d) The most senior leader or manager in the group voices his or her opinion last.    3.  At the end of each person’s time slot, all members take a quiet minute to:   a) Collect his or her own thoughts in response to the last speaker’s preferences.    b) Decide what he or she would be willing to compromise or have in common with the  last speaker.    4.  At the deadline:  a) The facilitator poses what seems to be the most common perspective voiced by  members.    b) Asks all members if they can support that perspective.    5.  If no consensus is reached, members might choose one of following options:   a) Consider further research until a specified future time.  Decide what additional  information is needed and maybe appoint a committee to do research.  The committee  researches and provides recommendations, preferably in writing to each member of  the group before the next meeting.  At the meeting, members hear the committee’s  recommendations and initiate the consensus process again.    b) Consider using a vote to decide (via rating or ranking).  Some people would assert  that voting is not consensus, but it sure is handy if the consensus process has not  reached a conclusion by an absolute deadline.  See the Voting Technique, later on  below, for a description of the rating and ranking approaches to voting.  12 Common Techniques in Facilitating Groups  Adapted from  Field Guide to Nonprofit Strategic Planning and Facilitation  © Authenticity Consulting, LLC    ®    www.authenticityconsulting.com    ®    800.971.2250    ®     of 10  Discussion Technique  1.  Specify the discussion topic and the goal to the planning group (if possible, do this step  as pre-work before the next meeting).  The goal is usually to identify, clarify, analyze  and/or select an item.    2.  It is often best if the topic is described in the form of a “yes/no” question or a choice from  among alternatives, for example, “Should we approve ___?”  or “Should we hire ____?”.  3.  Specify when the discussion is to start and stop.  4.  Allow for open, unassigned exchange of information, including, for example, questions,  suggestions and general comments, until it is time stop the discussion.  5.  Facilitate to focus the discussion around the topic.  6.  Attempt to capture key points on a flipchart.  Optional:  7.  Attempt to summarize the discussion by identifying conclusions or decisions from the  discussion.   8.  The group can make selections from the results using voting (ranking or rating) and/or  consensus techniques.    Facilitator Intervention Technique  The nature of the intervention depends on the nature of the problem in the group.    1.  If the group seems stuck, then it is appropriate to point this out to the entire group.  (Ideas  about how to handle this situation are included in the next subsection.)   2.  If there is prolonged conflict between certain members, then it may be more appropriate  to invite the members out of the group and to conduct an intervention among those  members.  (Ideas about how to handle this situation are included in the next subsection.)  3.  If a ground rule is being broken, then it may be appropriate to point this out to the entire  group.    There are a wide variety of intervention techniques, for example, summarizing, confronting,  making suggestions, asking questions, providing other perspectives, asking for clarity, reminding  the group about their ground rules and structuring activities.   Whenever intervening in a group, try to give the group an opportunity to take responsibility for  recognizing the situation and deciding what to do about it.  If an intervention is to the entire  group, consider:  1.  Briefly describe what you are seeing or hearing (in the here and now) that leads you to  conclude that there is a problem.  Do not just report what you feel or sense – try to be  more specific.     2.  Ask the group what they want to do.    3.  Be silent while group members react and discuss the situation.  4.  Focus the discussion on the problem at hand.  5.  Ask them for a decision.    12 Common Techniques in Facilitating Groups  Adapted from  Field Guide to Nonprofit Strategic Planning and Facilitation  © Authenticity Consulting, LLC    ®    www.authenticityconsulting.com    ®    800.971.2250    ®     of 10  Ground Rules Technique  Ground rules can be identified before the group meeting and then proposed to the group for their  review, modification and/or approval.  Or, the ground rules can be developed by members of the  group in a group meeting.  Some common ground rules are:  1.  Meetings start and stop on time.  2.  Focus on priorities, not on personalities.  3.  Everyone participates.  4.  All opinions are honored.   5.  No interruptions.   6.  No sidebars (or conversations not involving the main group).  Meeting Agendas Technique  1.  Design the agenda together with the organization’s leadership – do not design it yourself.   Ensure an effective meeting by first reflecting on the goals for the meeting and then the  activities to meet those goals.  2.  Think about how you label an event so that people come in with that mindset.  It may pay  to have a short dialogue around the label to develop a common mindset among attendees,  particularly if they include representatives from various cultures.  3.  Always include introductions or some type of “check in” early on so that all members get  involved early in the meeting.  4.  Be sure to dedicate time to reviewing status of actions assigned in previous meetings.  5.  Allow time for brief evaluations, or “satisfaction checks,” among the members.  6.  Next to each major topic, include the type of action needed, the type of output expected,  and time estimates for addressing each topic.  7.  Review the agenda at the beginning of each meeting, giving participants a chance to  understand all proposed major topics, change them and accept them.  8.  Ask participants if they will commit to the agenda.  9.  Keep the agenda posted at all times.  10.  Ensure a meeting recorder (or documenter) who documents major activities during the  meeting and actions to be conducted after the meeting.  This person should issue meeting  minutes shortly after the meeting (although meeting minutes may seem the most  perfunctory duty from a meeting, the minutes can end up being the most useful part of the  meeting by ensuring all actions are completed).  11.  In general, do not over design the meeting.  Be willing to adapt the meeting agenda if  members are making progress in the meeting.  12 Common Techniques in Facilitating Groups  Adapted from  Field Guide to Nonprofit Strategic Planning and Facilitation  © Authenticity Consulting, LLC    ®    www.authenticityconsulting.com    ®    800.971.2250    ®     of 10  Meeting Management Technique  Meeting management tends to be a set of skills often overlooked by facilitators and planners.   The following suggestions for facilitators apply to most meetings.  Facilitator Preparation for Meetings  Remember that your behavior sets the tone for the meeting.  Depending on your personality, you  should become as comfortable as possible before each meeting.  Regardless of your personality,  it is important to acknowledge to yourself whatever you are feeling about the meeting.  Note what might be the best and worst outcomes of the meeting, and realize the meeting will  probably be somewhere in between.  Developing Agendas  The agenda is the “roadmap” for the entire meeting, so it is very important to design the agenda  carefully.  See the above-listed “Meeting Agendas Technique.”  Opening Meetings  1.  Start on time.  This respects those who showed up on time and reminds any late-comers  that the meeting and its scheduling are serious.  2.  Ask if anyone is missing who should be present.  If there is anyone who should be there  and is not, visit the reason for the absence and address how to get him or her involved.  3.  Model the kind of energy and participation needed by the facilitator and meeting  participants.  4.  Clarify your roles for that meeting, that is, note when you will be doing any training,  facilitating, recording, etc.  Establishing Ground Rules for Meetings  The ground rules establish the overall “personality” of the meeting, so they are very important to  establish early on when working with a group.  See the subsection, “Ground Rules Technique.”  Time Management  One of the most difficult facilitation tasks is time management.  In a highly energized meeting,  time seems to run out before tasks are completed.  Therefore, the biggest challenge is keeping  momentum to keep the process moving.  1.  Consider asking the group for a volunteer to help monitor and remind the group about the  time.  2.  If the planned time on the agenda is getting out of hand, present it to the group members  and ask for their input as to a resolution.  3.  Adjourn a meeting when scheduled – rarely deter from this guideline.  It is far better to  adjourn a meeting even if members feel work is incomplete than to drag a meeting on and  on, with the illusion that everyone should leave the meeting with a strong sense of  closure.  Adjourning a meeting on time ensures that all members feel their time is  respected and they can continue to count on sound meeting management.  12 Common Techniques in Facilitating Groups  Adapted from  Field Guide to Nonprofit Strategic Planning and Facilitation  © Authenticity Consulting, LLC    ®    www.authenticityconsulting.com    ®    800.971.2250    ®     of 10  Evaluations During Meeting Process  Evaluation of the quality of a meeting is a critical, but often overlooked, requirement for  effective meetings.  Avoiding evaluations in an effort to “get more work done” in meetings is a  good example of working harder, rather than smarter.  Perhaps the most critical element of any  successful meeting is each member’s complete and responsible participation.  Round-Robin  evaluation is a useful technique for ensuring meetings include this full participation.  If the meeting is a long one, for example, more than 1.5 hours, then every hour or so, conduct a  5-minute “satisfaction check.”  Have each member visit his or her “internal weather” and report  his or her evaluation so that each person is involved (have the senior management provide their  evaluations last).  Far too many meetings end up with members going out of the room, remarking  to each other that the meeting was not useful.  Get this impression during the meeting so you can  do something about it.   Evaluating Overall Meeting  Leave 10 minutes near the end to evaluate the quality of the meeting.  Do not skip this portion of  the meeting.  The facilitator and planners can quickly learn a great deal about what is working  and what is not.    1.  Have each member rate the meeting from 1-5, with 1 as the lowest.  2.  Have the member explain his or her rating.   3.  Finally, have the member explain what he or she could have done in that meeting to now  be rating the meeting a 5.   Have the senior management provide their evaluations last.    Closing Meetings  At the end of a meeting, review actions and assignments, establish the time and location for the  next meeting, and ask group members if they can make it or not (to get their commitment).   Deciding membership in meetings is extremely important, but often overlooked.  Ask who  should be at the next meeting and ensure that someone is assigned to invite them.  Nominal Group Technique  There are many versions of the overall nominal group technique (NGT), which, in any form, is a  combination of various other techniques.  The technique usually includes various phases,  including:  1.  Facilitator clarifies the topic or goal to be addressed by the group, for example, to select  the most important items from a list.    2.  Ideas are collected from members of the group.    a) The Round-Robin technique is often used to compile an initial list of ideas.    b) Brainstorming is used to expand the compiled list of ideas.  12 Common Techniques in Facilitating Groups  Adapted from  Field Guide to Nonprofit Strategic Planning and Facilitation  © Authenticity Consulting, LLC    ®    www.authenticityconsulting.com    ®    800.971.2250    ®     of 10  3.  The overall list is organized and analyzed.    a) The discussion technique is often used.    b) The list is analyzed for overlaps, duplications, conflict, interdependences, etc.   4.  Ideas are selected from the overall list, using any of the following techniques.    § The discussion technique can be applied, depending on the nature of the members of  the group.  § The consensus technique can be applied if the group highly values strong  participation and egalitarian approaches to decision making.  § The voting technique can be used to make a final selection.    Parking Lot Technique  1.  One or more members of the group mentions that a matter before the group is not directly  related to the established topic or goal that the group wants to address.  2.  The facilitator or a group member suggests that the matter go on the “parking lot.”  3.  If group members agree with the suggestion, the matter is listed on a “parking lot,” which  is usually a flipchart sheet posted off to the side in the meeting room.  4.  Before the end of the meeting, members agree how the “parking lot” matters will be  addressed later on, if at all.   Round-Robin Technique  1.  The facilitator clarifies the topic or goal to be addressed by the group, for example, to  generate ideas about a topic or goal.    2.  Members get quiet time before the group meeting, or early in the group meeting, to  identify ideas on their own.   3.  In the meeting, the facilitator collects a list of ideas by getting one idea from one person  at a time, going around the table, until all members have shared all of the ideas from their  list.    4.  Members do not analyze or discuss any of the ideas until all ideas have been collected.   Members can ask a question during the Round-Robin, only to get clarification on a  suggested idea.    5.  The facilitator and members avoid duplication of ideas on the list.  Optional:  6.  Combine the ideas into common categories.  This can be done by using the discussion,  voting (ranking or rating) and/or consensus techniques.    7.  Select the most preferred categories and/or ideas.  This can be done by using the  discussion, voting (ranking or rating) and/or consensus techniques.    12 Common Techniques in Facilitating Groups  Adapted from  Field Guide to Nonprofit Strategic Planning and Facilitation  © Authenticity Consulting, LLC    ®    www.authenticityconsulting.com    ®    800.971.2250    ®     of 10  Stories Technique  Facilitator explains that the focus of this technique is on the positive by building on the strengths  and opportunities of the organization and its stakeholders.  Facilitator clarifies goal of technique,  for example, to establish vision, values and/or action plans.    1.  Each member quietly reflects on his or her best experience with the organization and the  people it serves.  2.  In pairs, members interview each other (each interview is 10 minutes long) about their  best experience, including about:  a) What made it the best experience?  What were they doing?  Who was involved?  b) What do they value about the organization and whom it serves now?  c) What would they like to be core value in the organization?  d) Three wishes for the organization and the people it serves?  3.  The interviewer documents the top 5-8 major themes in what the other person talked  about, for example, “helping other people, “ “feeling of fulfillment” and “working in a  team”.  The interviewer mentions the themes to the other person to get his or her  agreement, disagreement or modifications to the themes.   4.  Use the Round-Robin technique in the group to collect all of the themes.  Also, use  brainstorming technique to expand the list of themes if the group prefers.    5.  Use the voting technique (rating) to select the top 5-8 themes to include in the vision  and/or reflect in the values.  6.  Use the Round-Robin technique for each person to identify his or her action plans to  enact the vision and/or values.   12 Common Techniques in Facilitating Groups  Adapted from  Field Guide to Nonprofit Strategic Planning and Facilitation  © Authenticity Consulting, LLC    ®    www.authenticityconsulting.com    ®    800.971.2250    ®     of 10  Voting Technique  There are a variety of approaches to the voting technique.    Show of Hands  The most common approach to the technique is simply to ask for a show of hands regarding each  item on a list, one at a time, and the item that gets the most show of hands is the item that is  selected from the list.    Ranking  Ranking is assigning one distinct value to each item in order to select the single, most important  item from a list.  For example, a ranked list would have one item ranked as 1, three as 2 and four  as 3.    Rating  Rating is associating a value with each item in order to select a range of items from a list.  Some  items can have the same value associated with them.  For example, a rated list might have  several items rated as high, medium or low or as 1, 2 or 3.  Dot-Voting  A common approach to using the technique is as follows.   1.  Each member gets a certain number of votes that he or she can use regarding items on a  list.  The number of dots that they get is usually equal to the number of choices that are to  be made from a list.  For example, if three items are to be selected, then each person gets  three dots.  2.  Each member walks up to the overall list of items and places his or her dots next to the  items that the member recommends be selected from the list.  3.  After all members have cast their votes, the items that received the most votes get  selected from the list.    The dot-voting technique has variations.  Different colored dots can represent more than one  vote, or even a negative vote.  Sometimes, each participant is given one vote of each weight and  required to apply each vote to a different item.  In some cases, a member is allowed to cast  multiple votes for one item.
