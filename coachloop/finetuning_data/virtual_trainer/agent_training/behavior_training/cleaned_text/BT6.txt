ACKNOWLEDGMENTS There are many, many people I’m grateful to, including: My distributed cognition network, without whom this book would be much worse,  including Chris Atherton (book reviewer MVP & person who kept me from saying   anything too stupid about brains, although if I did, it’s not her fault), Dave Ferguson,  Janet Laane Effron, Simon Bostock, Rebecca Davis, and Mags Hanley (who kept  saying “That’s great, Julie, but how do you apply it?). The Peachpit/New Riders folks, Wendy Sharp, Susan Rimerman, Becky Winter  and, most of all, the lovely and patient Wendy Katz.  The people who made it pretty—Jeremy Beckman, who was unbelievably gener- ous with his time and creativity, Jess Duff, who made everything look better, and  Leigh Simmons, who was really patient with me and who, even though I couldn’t  ﬁgure out a way to use it in the book, originated the phrase “Ninja cake time!”  Also, the talented people who created the cover, interior design, and layout for  the book. Michael Allen, who is all you could wish for as a mentor, and Allen Interactions  for their sabbatical program (which allowed me to write the original book outline),  and for generously letting me use work I did at Allen Interactions (Bicycles!) in  this book. Kathy Sierra, who has been a huge inspiration and very supportive and is more  responsible for this book than she probably knows. All my incredible friends who have listened to me talk about this project for a  LONG time, including my own Whuppass Girls—Mags (who rates a second   mention), Samantha Bailey, and Lori Baker, along with Kathleen Sullivan, Lisa  Boyd, Michele McKenzie, Ann Woods, and Lyle Turner. Also, Susan Quakkelaar  and Lisa Stortz for their help and ideas, Jodi Hanson for her expert fashion advis- ing, and the lovely and supportive Laura and Alexandra Nedved who are Max’s  other family.

The delightful women at the Blue Moon Coffee Shop, where this was largely  written. and My parents and family, who managed to not freak out and even to be supportive   when I said “I think I’m going to quit my job and freelance so I can work on a book.” FOREWORD When working within the artiﬁcial intelligence group at Control Data Corporation  on advanced learning systems, a colleague questioned why we were using such  powerful systems as Cray mega computers for adaptive learning programs and  learning simulations. He understood why meteorology and military reconnaissance  applications needed them, but why educational systems? Meteorology dealt with  vast amounts of data and yet needed to predict future weather quickly. Airborne  reconnaissance had to compare visual data from separate ﬂights and perspectives  to recognize which objects had moved and which hadn’t. But instruction? Many people surmise yet today that instructional software can’t make much  computing demand. How hard is it to present and score multiple-choice questions? I asked my colleague, what causes meteorology and reconnaissance to make  heavy computational demands? He replied, the extremely large amounts of data to  be gathered and managed, the rapid analysis that was needed, and the need to visualize  the results. Hmm. It sounded familiar—like working with human learners. I asked  him how much data he thought the human brain might typically contain and  what level of complex analysis he thought it capable of. How would it compare  to our largest computer? What level of common knowledge and reasoning had  we achieved in our intelligent systems? How did that compare to working with  people? What level of computation might be required to perform the tasks of a  talented teacher and mentor? With an estimated capacity of somewhere between 10 and 100 terabytes and  with little-understood capabilities far beyond our most capable computers, the  human brain is phenomenally complex. It’s amazingly capable and surprisingly  unpredictable. It’s both rational and emotional. It’s perceptive and yet selectively  so. It can remember large amounts of data and yet has the advantages of forget- ting. And each of us has a unique one. The challenges of creating highly effective learning experiences are numerous.  We’re fortunate that humans are, in many ways, learning creatures. We are gen- erally eager to learn. We intuitively know that knowledge is power. Skills turn  knowledge into actionable advantages. We want skills and enjoy having them.  But even with all these advantages, it isn’t easy to transmit knowledge and build  skills. Thinking of instructional technology as computer-delivered multiple-choice  questions reveals how misunderstood the challenges are. Regardless of how instruction is delivered—through instructor-led activities,  e-learning, or other means—structuring effective learning experiences requires  knowledge of How People Learn. So much instruction is developed and delivered   vi FOREWORD vi through paradigms born of tradition rather than of knowledge. They are ineffec- tive. They are boring. They are wasteful. And yet, the science of the human brain is not a well-rounded guide for the prep- aration of learning experiences. Considerations, yes. Helpful, yes. Best practices,  no. Eager for cookbook-like guidance, many look to research for widely applicable  principles, yet most research ﬁndings are applicable only within narrow conﬁnes.  When brain and learning research conﬂict with experience, experience is the bet- ter guide. Wisdom in learning design takes years to acquire. It takes focus, dedi- cation, hard work, and an observant approach. Yet through this richness of varied  context, experience has broad applicability that cannot be gained otherwise. Through Julie Dirksen’s extensive experience in designing learning experiences  for wide varieties of learners in very different contexts, she clariﬁes why tradi- tional instructional approaches are so ineffective. We learn from Julie’s wisdom,  for example, that while practice is important and so often omitted or minimized,  there are more effective approaches to building long-term retention than simple  repetition. We learn why words are a poor substitute for demonstration and  example. We learn the power of context. Traditional instructional design approaches focus heavily on content—getting  it complete and accurate. Then making presentations as clear as possible. Then  making assessments precise. Concerns about the learning experience, making it   meaningful, memorable, and motivational, may not even enter into the discussion.  I guess it’s no wonder that we have so many boring and ineffective programs. I’m delighted to have this witty, insightful, cleverly illustrated guide. My hope  is that it will help designers shed the shackles of “tell and test” traditions from  which learners are victimized by passive presentations of information followed by  short-term retention tests. True, most of us had no choice but to learn from such  instruction and survive. But there’s no indication this should be the paradigm of  choice. Watching Jay Leno’s Jay Walking segments or Are You Smarter Than a 5th  Grader? should be evidence enough that our educational traditions aren’t working  well. It’s time to work smarter. Michael W.

What was it like? Got one? I’ve asked this question dozens of times, and gotten a variety of  answers. Sometimes the answer is that someone was really passionate about  what they were learning, but the most frequent answer is: Nobody ever says “I had the most amazing textbook” or “There was this really  great PowerPoint deck!” x INTRODUCTION That suggests that a lot of what makes for a great learning experience is not  about the content, but is about the way the content is taught. In fact, a class can  cover the same material but be very different, depending on how the material   is taught: So what’s the special sauce? How are the two experiences different? When   it’s two different teachers, some of the differences are due to personality  or charisma, but those aren’t usually the only differences. And when it’s an  e-learning course, there’s no teacher at all. How is a really good e-learning  course different from just reading a textbook online? Even more important, what’s the difference between a learning experience  that’s effective versus one that gets forgotten as soon as the learner is done?  Even “awesome” classes are useless if the learner doesn’t do something dif- ferent afterwards. While some learning experiences are “learning for the sake  of learning,” I won’t really address those in this book. (Disclaimer: I work with  adult learners, usually in a professional setting, so while the book will address  examples from multiple contexts, the majority will relate to adult learning  experiences.) xi INTRODUCTION For me, the goal of good learning design is for learners to emerge from the  learning experience with new or improved capabilities that they can take back  to the real world, that help them do the things they need or want to do. If your  learners are on a journey from novice to expert, how can you help them along  that path? This book looks at some of the things involved in designing great learning  experiences: Chapter 1: Where Do We Start?  If learning is a journey, what’s the route like for your learners, and what’s the  gap between where they are and where they need to be? Sometimes that gap is  knowledge, but just as often the gap can be skills, motivation, or environment.  Learn how to identify each of these. Chapter 2: Who Are Your Learners? Your learners see the world differently than you do, and to design effective  learning experiences, you need to understand their view of the world. Chapter 3: What’s The Goal? The best learning experiences are designed with a clear destination in mind, but  sometimes a clear destination can be harder to pin down than it seems. Learn  how to determine your destination with accuracy. xii INTRODUCTION Chapter 4: How Do We Remember? Learn about how the brain works to focus on and retain information. Chapter 5: How Do You Get Their Attention? The ﬁrst prerequisite for learning is to get your learners’ attention. Learn strategies  for getting past the distractions and helping your learners to focus. Chapter 6: Design for Knowledge The most common type of learning experience focuses on teaching knowledge.  Learn strategies to make this as effective as possible. Chapter 7: Design for Skills If you ask the question “Is it reasonable to think that some can be proﬁcient  without practice?” and the answer is “No,” then you aren’t teaching informa- tion, you are teaching a skill, and skills require practice. Learn strategies for  helping your learners get the practice they need to develop skills. Chapter 8: Design for Motivation If you’ve ever heard a learner say the words “I know, but…” then you are probably  not dealing with a knowledge gap, but rather a motivational one. Learn strategies  for getting your learners not only to learn more, but also to do more. Chapter 9: Design for Environment We can get people to hold more information in their heads, or alternately, we  can learn better ways to make information available to them in their environment,  so they can get it when they need it. Chapter 10: Conclusion 83 4 Memory is the foundation of learning, so let’s take a few pages to talk  about how learners actually learn and remember stuff. How does all  that knowledge get in there on any given day? And how do we ﬁnd  and retrieve it when we need it? There’s a lot we still don’t know about the nature of memory, but we  do have some ideas and models for how it works. First, we’ll look at  how we pay attention and encode information into memory. Second,  we’ll look at different types of memory. HOW DO WE  REMEMBER? HOW DO WE  REMEMBER?  (In which we learn that memory is  messy and that biking straight uphill  isn’t a good way to learn) 84 CHAPTER 4 HOW DO WE REMEMBER? MEMORY IN & OUT Successful learning involves encoding and retrieval—memory in and memory  out. Remembering is a necessary ﬁrst step, but you need to be able to retrieve,  manipulate, combine, and innovate with the information you remember. Information in your brain doesn’t just sit there like a wool sweater during sum- mertime. When you put information in, it doesn’t lie passively waiting to be  taken out, but instead it interacts with other information. So your brain isn’t  really a closet. In order for your brain to be like a closet, it would have to be a super-automated  closet that reorganizes itself constantly, or one that’s populated by some kind of  closet elves who are continually moving and arranging things. Also, anything you put in your closet automatically gets stored in multiple  categories, so the blue socks your grandmother knitted for you would simulta- neously (and magically) be put with things that are wool, things that are blue,  85 MEMORY IN & OUT socks, outﬁts that go with those socks, stuff from grandma, things that are  starting to wear out, and so on. What’s more, the self-organizing closet has multiple, overlapping ways to keep  track of things. So when you put away those blue socks in the “socks” drawer,  the closet can retrieve them by looking on the “things that are wool” shelf, or on  the “things that are blue” hanger. Your brain is a dynamic, multi-faceted, constantly changing entity. Anything  you retain from this book will change the physical structure of your brain by cre- ating new connections and strengthening (or weakening) existing connections.  So what winds up sticking? We are bombarded with millions and millions of  data points all day long. We can’t possibly attend to—much less remember—  all of them. Fortunately, you have a series of ﬁlters and triggers that allows you to parse this  information: • Sensory memory. This type of memory is your ﬁrst ﬁlter of everything you  sense and perceive. If you choose to pay attention to something, it gets  passed on to short-term memory. • Short-term memory. This is the memory that allows you to hold on to ideas  or thoughts long enough to take action. Most things get discarded out of  short-term memory, but some things get encoded into long-term memory. • Long-term memory. This is your closet, where you store information that  you’ll keep for a while. Let’s take a closer look at each of these. 86 CHAPTER 4 HOW DO WE REMEMBER? SENSORY MEMORY The ﬁrst level of memory is sensory memory. Basically pretty much anything  you sense is held momentarily in your sensory memory. Most sensations keep right on going, unless there’s something unusual or note- worthy about what you are sensing.  For example, stop right now and pay attention to all the noises you can hear.   If you are indoors, you are likely hearing the hum of an air conditioning or heat- ing unit, or noise from appliances or computers. If you are outside, there will be  environmental noises depending on your location.  Unless someone or something calls your attention to one of these, you probably  weren’t paying attention to those noises, and you were certainly not encoding  those noises into your memory. HABITUATION Sensory memory isn’t a big concern for learning designers, except for the phe- nomena of habituation. Habituation means getting used to a sensory stimulus,  to the point that we no longer notice or respond to it. Habituation is what allows you to stop noticing the annoying refrigerator buzz  after you’ve been listening to it for a while, or when you stop even noticing that  “check engine” light on the dashboard when it’s been on for weeks. If things are unpredictable, they can be harder to habituate to. For example,  the horrible torment of a ﬂickering ﬂuorescent light persists long after you’ve  stopped hearing the hum from the computer monitor, because the unpredict- able pattern of the ﬂicker keeps calling our attention to it over and over and over… 87 MEMORY IN & OUT Similarly, being stuck in trafﬁc stays infuriating because it’s rarely uniform (start…  stop…start…little faster…STOP…go…go go …Go…GOGOGOGO… Stoooop!).  People can also habituate to things that we don’t necessarily want them to.  For example, when was the last time you paid much attention to the advertise- ments in the banner at the top of web pages? You’ve probably learned how to  tune those out. Web designers refer to that as “banner blindness,” and eye- tracking studies (Nielsen 2007) verify that people not only don’t pay much  attention to banner ads, they frequently don’t look at them at all. (The same  thing can happen with resource and reference material we provide for learners  on websites and in e-learning courses!) IMPLICATIONS FOR LEARNING DESIGN Consistency can be useful. Consistency can be a useful tool to make things  easier for your learner. For example, if you use the same basic format for each  chapter of a technical manual, your learners get used to the format and don’t  have to expend mental energy repeatedly orienting themselves to the format;  instead, they can focus on the content of the chapters. Too much consistency is bad. However, too much consistency can lead to  habituation in your learners. You want to vary your teaching methods and the  way you present information. For example, if you are creating an e-learning   program and you give the same type of feedback in the same location every  single time, then learners are going to learn to ignore it, particularly if the feed- back is the generic “Good Job!” kind. Another example of too much consistency   is the “banner blindness” mentioned above. Annoying variability is bad, too. While some variation is useful for keeping the  learner’s attention, meaningless differences are just irritating. For example, if  you take that e-learning feedback box and have it randomly pop up in different  areas of the screen, it will probably keep the learner from habituating to it as  quickly, but it’s also going to really annoy them. A better approach would be to  have different feedback formats that are appropriate to the different types of  content you are presenting, or to use a variety of different learning activities to  keep things interesting. Variation can be a useful tool for maintaining attention,  but it should be used in a deliberate and meaningful way. 88 CHAPTER 4 HOW DO WE REMEMBER? The best way to know if something is too consistent is through user testing.  Watch your learners interact with print or electronic materials, or pilot test a  class—if your learners are inattentive or seem to obviously ignore resource  materials, that’s a clue that they’ve start to gloss past those elements.  SHORT-TERM OR WORKING MEMORY Once something has attracted your attention, it moves into your short-term  or working memory. If it succeeds in penetrating your short-term memory, it’s  probably something that: • Is signiﬁcant to you for some reason • You are looking for • You need to take action on  • Surprises or confounds your expectations Working memory has a relatively short duration and limited capacity, but you  use it pretty much constantly throughout the day. WHAT DO YOU RETAIN? For example, let’s say you are deciding what to wear to work today. You glance  at the weather (cool and rainy), and at your schedule (client meeting). You hold  those two things in working memory while you check your closet. You also retrieve  some information from long-term memory (the conference room is always hot;  the black suit is at the cleaners because of that unfortunate guacamole stain).  New information in working memory Pulled from long-term memory Cool and rainy weather Conference room is always hot Client meeting Black suit is at the cleaners All this information gets processed together as you make the decision to wear layers. Working memory will discard most pieces of information as soon as you’re  done with them, like the wiﬁ password at the coffee shop, the number of the  freeway exit you need to take, or the phone number that you recite over and  over until you can get it dialed. 89 MEMORY IN & OUT All of those types of information are the kind of thing that you might keep in  working memory for the few seconds that you will need it. If it takes you longer,  you might also keep it there via repetition. Repetition will refresh the information in working memory until you use it and  stop repeating. If you repeat something long enough, you will eventually grind it  into long-term memory, but that’s not the most efﬁcient method (we’ll discuss  better methods later). Some information will drop out more quickly if it doesn’t  have signiﬁcance.  Let’s take a look at the following three pieces of information you might hear in  the morning news radio report. Information: The temperature is 12 degrees Celsius. Factors that inﬂuence retention: •   Is it unusual? If it’s signiﬁcantly different than the weather for the last few  days, it’s more likely to catch your attention.  •   Is it important to you? You’ll retain it better if the weather affects your plans  for the day. •   Is it a familiar format? If you ordinarily use Fahrenheit, you’re unlikely to  remember the Celsius temperature, because you won’t know if it means you  should wear your coat. If you do remember it for the length of the day, it’s still unlikely you’ll continue  to remember it days or weeks later, unless there was something signiﬁcant  about the date (e.g., your brother’s wedding day).  90 CHAPTER 4 HOW DO WE REMEMBER? Information: The Dow Jones industrial average is up 56 points, or 0.5 percent,  to 11,781. Factors that inﬂuence retention: The same issues apply. Does this contrast  with previous days or expectations? Is this signiﬁcant to you because you work  with the ﬁnancial markets, or are waiting to sell some stock? Information: UConn Huskies lost to the Stanford Cardinals 71-59. Factors that inﬂuence retention: You are likely to retain this information only  if you follow US Women’s college basketball, or if you know that this was the  ﬁrst game the UConn team had lost after setting the record for the most con- secutive games won (89 in a row). If you don’t have that context, you probably  won’t retain any part of that information. WHAT’S THE LIMIT? How much can you hold in working memory? There is a fair amount of research  on the limits of working memory, and there’s a well-known statistic about 7  2  items in working memory, but the real answer is it depends. (Miller 1956) In all likelihood, you can’t repeat all the data from the previous table (the tem- perature, the Dow Jones numbers, and the sports scores) without going back  and checking it again. The main reason you can’t is because those numbers  have no signiﬁcance for you, beyond being an example in this book.  An additional reason would be the quantity of information—there were several  discrete facts in that table (12°, Celsius, Dow Jones, 56 points, 0.5%, 11, 781,  UConn Huskies, Stanford Cardinal, 71, 59). That’s more pieces of individual  information than most people can remember without some kind of memory aid  or device.  Read this number, and then close your eyes and try to repeat it: 6 7 1 8  How’d you do? In all likelihood you did pretty well at retaining that brieﬂy. Four  discrete digits is usually well within the limits of working memory. 91 MEMORY IN & OUT Now try this number: 9 3 4 8 7 1 6 2 5 That one is a little harder, right? Maybe you were  able to retain all nine digits, but if you dropped some  digits they were likely to be somewhere in the middle  of the string of numbers. That would be an example  of primacy and recency effects, which suggest we are  more likely to remember something at the beginning  of a sequence or list (primacy) and also more likely to  remember the most recent things, as at the end of a  list (recency).  OK, now try this one: 100   500   800 That’s a whole lot easier, right? It’s the same number of digits, but it’s chunked.  Instead of remembering individual digits, you are remembering something   like this: [ﬁrst three digits] + [next three digits] + [last three digits] This is three chunks of information, rather than nine separate chunks of  information. Even easier is: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Because you already know how to count to nine, this is just one chunk of infor- mation for you: [digits 1–9 in order] Chunking can be based on things that are similar, sequential, or items that are in  your long-term memory.  For example, try this number: 6 1 2    6 5 1    7 6 3    9 5 2  In all likelihood, this is too much information for you to retain in working mem- ory, unless you live in the Minneapolis / St. Paul area, where these are the local  telephone area codes.  92 CHAPTER 4 HOW DO WE REMEMBER? WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR LEARNING DESIGN? Who memorizes strings of numbers anymore? Doesn’t everybody have a   cell phone?  We are fortunate to have devices we can use to ofﬂoad tedious details, and  most people don’t have any need to remember random strings of numbers  (which is a good thing, because humans mostly suck at that particular task,  while electronic devices are brilliant at it). But using chunking in learning—whether it involves large numbers or large  amounts of textual or perhaps even visual information—will help your learners  manage their working memory, and help them understand where to focus their  limited attention at any given point. Let’s say you are teaching somebody a procedure—for example, how to bake   an apple pie. Take a look at this list of steps: Mix together the ﬂour and the salt. Chill the butter and water. Add the butter to the ﬂour and cut it with a pastry blender until it resembles coarse crumbs. Add enough water until the dough barely hangs together. Cut the dough in half and make two balls. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Peel the apples. Core and quarter the apples and cut into 1/4” slices. Mix the apples with sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, and a small amount of ﬂour. Roll out one of the pieces of pie dough into a circle slightly larger than your pie pan. Fold the pie dough in half and lift it into the pie pan. Press the dough into the pan. Fill the pie dough with the apple mixture. Roll the other piece of dough into a circle. Place the dough on top of the pie and crimp the edges. Cut steam holes in the top crust. Bake the pie for 45 min in a 350° oven. That’s a lot of steps, right? A bit much for someone to process. If they know a  lot about baking, they’ll be able to parse that information in a way that makes  sense, but if the learner doesn’t have a lot of context for pie-making, then this  list is likely to overwhelm them quickly.  93 MEMORY IN & OUT There’s no cue to tell them when to stop reading the new information for a  moment, and process the existing information. There’s also no higher-level  organization for the material—it’s just a long list of steps. Which is why you  want to look for opportunities to chunk that information: Prepare the dough Mix together the ﬂour and the salt. Chill the butter and water. Add the butter to the ﬂour and cut it with a pastry blender until it resembles coarse  crumbs. Add enough water until the dough barely hangs together. Cut the dough in half and make two balls. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Prepare the filling Peel the apples. Core and quarter the apples and cut into 1/4” slices. Mix the apples with sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, and a small amount of ﬂour. Assemble the pie Roll out one of the pieces of pie dough into a circle slightly larger than your pie pan. Fold the pie dough in half and lift it into the pie pan. Press the dough into the pan. Fill the pie dough with the apple mixture. Roll the other piece of dough into a circle. Place the dough on top of the pie and crimp the edges. Bake the pie Cut steam holes in the top crust. Bake the pie for 45 min in a 350° oven. Even just chunking the steps into four categories makes the whole procedure  much easier for people to process and remember. Chunking isn’t magically  going to allow the learner to remember the whole recipe, but it will help them   to focus on a single section at any one time, and the steps in an individual   chunk are a more realistic quantity of information to hold in working memory.  Working memory acts as a gatekeeper for long-term memory, so if the initial  information overloads working memory, it’s unlikely to make the transition to  long-term memory. 94 CHAPTER 4 HOW DO WE REMEMBER? LONG-TERM MEMORY, OR IS IT IN YOUR CLOSET? Ultimately, when we are teaching or learning something, what we really want is  for the information to reach long-term memory—ﬁrmly situated in the closet,   in a place where we can ﬁnd it again easily. WHERE DO YOU PUT IT? Anything that you do remember becomes part of a series of associations—  you don’t learn anything in isolation. For example, say you’ve just learned that the German word for mustache is  Schnurrbart. Now, in all likelihood, you don’t care about this information, and  you will let it wash out of your short-term memory without a ripple. But suppose there is some reason you need to retain this information (a German  vocabulary test, a fascination with words that sound like sneezes, an interest  in European facial hair trends). How will you encode it? Well, of course, that  depends on the shape of your closet, and the types of shelves that you have for  that information. Fortunately, you don’t have to choose a single association— you can store this item on all of those shelves simultaneously. More (and better) associations will make it easier to retrieve the information.  If you don’t have a good shelving system for this word, you can create a mne- monic for it (tell yourself a story about sitting across from a German man with  an elaborate mustache while riding the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system,  for example).  If you already speak German, you probably wouldn’t need a mnemonic, as  you’d already have a much more sophisticated shelving system for this word,  95 MEMORY IN & OUT involving the root meanings of the parts of the word (“bart” means beard in  German), or other associations.  Your ability to retrieve information depends on the condition and contents of  the shelves it’s stored on in your mental closet. MULTIPLE SHELVES The more ways you have to ﬁnd a piece of information, the easier it is to  retrieve, so an item that goes on only one or two shelves is going to be harder   to retrieve than an item that goes on many shelves.  For example, let’s take two ﬁve-digit numbers: My mother’s zip code and the  salary offer I had for my ﬁrst job after graduate school. I don’t have many shelves for the ﬁrst number: I don’t use this number very often, and I don’t have very many ways to access  the information (I either remember it or I don’t). In fact, these days I don’t actu- ally remember it, and have to get it from one of the external resources I use to  supplement my memory (like an address book or a contact ﬁle on my phone). Basically, I have only one place to look for that number, and if that doesn’t work,  I don’t have any other way to retrieve that information.  The salary offer, however, was a number with a lot more signiﬁcance (sorry,  Mom), and could be put on quite a few more shelves. As a result, I have multiple ways to access that information. I know it was  almost twice what I was making before I went to graduate school, it was 10%  less than a friend of mine made with the same degree (she was a much better  negotiator), and I know how it compares to my current salary.  96 CHAPTER 4 HOW DO WE REMEMBER? The more shelves you can put an item on, the more likely that you'll be able to  retrieve it in the future. This is the problem with pure memorization tasks, such  as ﬂash cards—things you’ve learned that way tend to be on only one shelf (the  “things you’ve memorized” shelf), which makes them harder to retrieve.  POORLY CONSTRUCTED SHELVES Some of my shelves are pretty weak, and allow information to slip through.   For example, I was trying to learn some Japanese before a trip a few years ago.  Instead of a sturdy wooden shelf, my shelf for Japanese vocabulary was more  like a rickety wire rack—I would carefully balance a few words and phrases  there, but they’d frequently slip through, and I wouldn’t ﬁnd them when I went  back to retrieve something. Part of the reason my shelf for Japanese was so rickety was because I had so  little context for Japanese. If I was trying to learn Spanish, I would have a stur- dier shelf for that language despite being a novice it. My Spanish shelf would be  strengthened by all the context I have for Spanish (things like similar Latin roots  to some words in English, a close relationship to Italian, which I do know a little,  and years of watching Spanish language vocabulary cartoons on Sesame Street  as a child). CROWDED SHELVES A shelf that is crowded may not be speciﬁc enough. That can happen when you  have a lot of information but not a very sophisticated structure for organizing  that information. It makes it much more difﬁcult to retrieve items accurately. For example, my shelf for jazz music is pretty crowded—not because I know a  lot about jazz (I don’t), but rather because everything I do know about jazz— a speciﬁc artist name, that one piece that always makes me smile, the time  period in which a certain style of jazz was born—all pretty much gets crammed  on a single shelf labeled “Jazz.” This means I have a really hard time retrieving  speciﬁc information about jazz. My shelves for ’80s popular music, on the other hand, are embarrassingly well- developed. There are shelves for different genres, for American groups, British  groups, hair bands, Americana, MTV, music videos, stuff I owned on LP, stuff  I owned on cassette, bands I saw in concert, and so on (too bad you can’t just  deliberately choose to “unlearn” things). 97 MEMORY IN & OUT UNINTENDED SHELVES Sometimes associations are unintended. For example, a few years ago I was in  Washington DC, staying a few blocks away from the Fannie Mae building while  the mortgage association was being heavily discussed in the news. There was  a lush bed of lavender plants in front of the building, and you couldn’t walk by  without smelling lavender.  Now, the Federal National Mortgage Association is forever on my lavender  shelf (and vice versa).  This happens far more often than we realize. Our brain creates numerous   associations that we may or may not be aware of, utilizing all our senses   (sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell). While these associations are somewhat random, they are still part of the   associations we use to retrieve information. Let’s take a look at how those   associations can actually be used.  IN-CONTEXT LEARNING Pop quiz: You’re taking a class at the local university and have an in-class exam  the next week. Where is the best place to study for a test? A. Outside under a tree in peaceful sunshine B. In your grey windowless classroom with a noisy air conditioning system C. In a quiet, well-lit library D. In a noisy coffee shop The answer may be surprising: it’s B, the grey windowless classroom. Yes, the  one with the noisy air conditioning system. Why? Because the environment in  which you study will become part of your association with the material you are  studying. When possible, you want to encode the information in the same type  of environment where you will also be retrieving that information. The same is true for information that needs to be retrieved in a particular con- text, such as on the job. The further the learning is from the context of use, the  fewer shelves are being utilized to store the information.  98 CHAPTER 4 HOW DO WE REMEMBER? The context of the classroom is only helping you remember if you need to  retrieve that information in a classroom. But we learn all sorts of information in  classrooms that we need to apply later. Topics like plumbing and journalism and  geology and hazardous materials handling are all taught in environments that  are very different from the environments where those subjects will be used.  We have a tendency to hold classes in bare rooms far away from the place that  use is going to happen, and that is a disservice to learners. Deep down, we know this is true. Whenever lives are at stake, training almost  always involves in-context learning. Even if the context is simulated—for the  safety of the students or those around them—it’s a rich, realistic context.  Examples of in-context learning include ﬂight simulators, teaching hospitals,  and actual driving practice during driver’s education. If possible, you want to encode the information in the same type of environ- ment where you will also be retrieving that information.  99 MEMORY IN & OUT Isn’t it inconceivable that drivers’ education wouldn’t involve actually road  time? We wouldn’t ever think someone could be a safe driver until they had  actual experience driving in real trafﬁc. Eventually simulators may be good  enough and cheap enough to replace road practice, but for now, we take it for  granted that learning to drive involves practice in the real context. So why is out-of-context training acceptable in other circumstances?  Frequently, it’s a matter of convenience or cost or practicality. These can be  very real constraints. For example, it might be nice to teach a server adminis- tration class in your actual server room, but you just can’t get 30 people into a  room the size of a large closet. When practical constraints require that the learning can’t happen in the physi- cal space, there are still ways to increase the context. For example, if the class   is about the physical setup of computer servers, it should involve hands-on  contact with the equipment, even if it can’t take place in the server room.  Many times, though, learning happens in an out-of-context environment like a  bare, featureless classroom because of habit, tradition, or lack of awareness.  There are a variety of ways to make learning more in-context, despite practical  constraints.  Think about ways you might improve or increase the context for learning   experiences in the following scenarios: Scenario 1: You need to teach consumers about the features of a new cell phone. How would you make this a high-context experience? Consider how you might  do it before reading the answer below. Some possible design solutions ➜ Ideally, the learner would be interacting   with those features on the actual phone as part of the learning experience,  and would be trying them out. Additionally, anything that could be done  to make the features part of actual use scenarios tailored to the audience  would enhance context. So the learning experience would be real tasks  that someone would do (texting a friend, entering a work contact), rather  than just a guided tour of the features. 100 CHAPTER 4 HOW DO WE REMEMBER? Scenario 2: You’ve been given the task of teaching college students how to  make nutritionally balanced meals. What can you do to increase the context for  this learning experience? Some possible design solutions ➜ The learning experience should match  the ﬁnal setting as much as possible, which could mean operating in a  cruddy dorm kitchen, using cheap cooking equipment from the local chain  store, and reﬂecting the actual food scenarios. Another option would be  to use photos of actual student refrigerators and challenge your learners  to identify ways to make a healthy meal from the contents. Scenario 3: You are creating a course to teach fast-food restaurant managers  how to give employees constructive feedback. How would you make this learn- ing experience high context? Some possible design solutions ➜ Consider in what setting the feedback  would take place, and use role-playing to practice. You could have managers   create triggers for themselves by doing a mental tour of the restaurant, and   thinking about what behaviors they would praise at each station. They could   create a checklist for themselves of what to look for, where to look for it, and  what to do if they see it. EMOTIONAL CONTEXT One of the most difﬁcult types of context to create for learning situations is  emotional context. Let’s take the employee feedback example. Let’s say you are in a class with  other students, and you are learning the principles of giving difﬁcult feedback.  What’s the mood like in the classroom? Everybody is probably calm, nobody is   upset. People are being serious and thoughtful as beﬁts a classroom environment.  Now, think about the environment when you have to use what you learned.  There’s a good chance you are nervous, maybe anxious. The person you are  talking to is probably unhappy, upset, or even hostile.  101 MEMORY IN & OUT In this instance, the emotional context while learning about the material and  then while applying it are very different. Many things seem reasonable when  we are learning about them, like, when dealing with a hostile employee, staying  calm, using “I” statements, validating the other person’s point of view, etc.  But then you are actually confronted with a really angry person, and all that good  advice ﬂies out of your head, and ﬁght-or-ﬂight reactions surge to the front and  you couldn’t compose a validating “I” statement if your life depended on it.  We may be prepared with the knowledge and the protocols, but unable to  implement them in the unfamiliar emotional context. I believe this is why a lot of learning fails. Have you ever said to yourself “I knew  the right thing to do, but…” The difference between knowing and doing can be a  huge gap when the context of encoding and the context of retrieval are signiﬁ- cantly different. 102 CHAPTER 4 HOW DO WE REMEMBER? There are many things we learn where the emotional context for use is drasti- cally different than the emotional context for learning. We can be trying to  retrieve the information when we are in a stressed or otherwise heightened  emotional state: Stressful or emotionally heightened circumstances can cause us to rely less on  our intellectual knowledge and more on our automatic responses. This makes   it more difﬁcult to transfer something learned in a placid emotional context to   a fraught emotional context.  So how can you create proper and effective emotional contexts? There are  several ways: Use role-playing. Even though we know it’s not real, role-playing can be an  effective way to create the feel of the emotional context, especially if you have  someone effective playing the part. Even though it won’t be exactly the same,  just having practiced saying the words out loud make them easier to recall in  real-life situations. Create pressure. Even if the pressure is different, sometimes adding elements  of similar pressure can create similar feelings. For example, a tight time limit  on responses can create time pressure, which can approximate the emotional  context of other types of pressure.  103 MEMORY IN & OUT Invest in high-quality stories, acting, and performance. If it’s critical material,  get good actors or voice actors, and establish a strong emotional setup. ENCODING FOR RETRIEVAL, OR HOW WILL IT NEED TO BE USED? One of the things you will also want to consider is how the information will  need to be used when it’s retrieved. Will the learners only need to recognize the  information, will they need to recall it outright, or will they need to be able to  use it to actually do something? You want the information encoding to align with assessment and use.  If someone is just going to need to recognize the right answer, then recognition  activities are good ways to learn and practice. If someone needs to recall some- thing unprompted, then they will need to learn and practice by recalling, not  just by recognizing. 104 CHAPTER 4 HOW DO WE REMEMBER? Which question is easier to answer? Question 1: The French word for pool is                                                                              . (ﬁll in the blank) Question 2: The French word for pool is:   a) Roman      b) Piscine      c) Plage      d) Plume The second question is easier, right? Recognizing the right answer from a set of  options almost always involves less effort than recalling the answer. Learning experiences frequently rely heavily on recognition activities such as  multiple-choice questions. This is particularly true in e-learning, where the  computer is used to evaluate the correctness of student answers. This is primarily  a practical choice. Recognition activities are easier to grade—computers can do  it for us. Recall activities usually require a person to evaluate.  A PRACTICAL EXAMPLE Look at the examples on the facing page for practicing and assessing a learner’s  CPR proﬁciency. Are they good examples? Why or why not? Stop and decide  which one is the best before reading further. CPR requires recall—remembering the right steps and how to do them properly.  None of the activities you see here are really recall activities. They are mostly  recognition activities.  The simulation comes the closest, but you can still simply guess. Also, the con- text is problematic—it’s very different to click on the virtual chest of a patient  on a computer screen rather than to apply pressure to an actual patient.  These learning activities might be part of a good learning experience, but they  don’t actually allow the learner to practice recalling the steps in the way that  they will need to in a real-life situation.  105 MEMORY IN & OUT 106 CHAPTER 4 HOW DO WE REMEMBER? So how can you create learning activities that are a better match for the real- world application? • Ensure that the practice involves recall or application. • Ensure that the practice and assessment are high-context. 107 MEMORY IN & OUT • Use job aids to change something from a recall to a recognition task. Job aids  change the task from “recall the steps” to “follow these steps,” reducing the  need to rely on memory. If you do use job aids, give your learners a chance to  practice with the job aid as part of the learning. We’ll talk more about this in  later chapters. In the end, the practice needs to match the eventual use. If the learner just  needs enough familiarity to recognize the right option, then practicing with  recognition activities will be sufﬁcient. If the learner needs to recall the mate- rial, or to do something more sophisticated like integrate the material, then the  practice activities need to reﬂect that eventual use.  REAL VS PERCEIVED KNOWLEDGE Frequently we think we know something because we recognize it—we think we  know more than we actually do know.  What I think I know:        What I actually know: 108 CHAPTER 4 HOW DO WE REMEMBER? So my conviction that I know the multiplication tables is a little suspect. I appar- ently know some parts of the multiplication tables, and I know some strategies  for extending that knowledge (which is fortunate, because I would apparently  be multiplication-illiterate without those strategies).  Let’s say you are studying for an exam. You are chewing your pencil, reading  your textbook, and nodding—it all looks pretty familiar. You’ve been studying  like that for a while, and you are feeling pretty good about the whole thing.  Then you get to class, and you see this: Recognition knowledge—the kind that might have gotten you through a multiple- choice test—is suddenly inadequate in the face of a mostly blank sheet of paper. If you want to eventually retrieve information from your memory, you need to  practice retrieving it when you study. (Karpicke 2011)  When you are teaching, you need to make sure that your learning activities  allow your learners to practice in the same way that they will need to perform.  109 TYPES OF MEMORY TYPES OF MEMORY So far, we’ve been talking generally about the way a stimulus gets encoded  into long-term memory, but there isn’t just one general type of memory. There  are actually several different types of memory that are encoded and retrieved  in distinct ways. Some types of memory will be more appropriate to focus on  depending on your subject matter, and learning design can often beneﬁt from  taking advantage of different types of memory. There’s a well-known story in psychology about an amnesia patient who did not  have the ability to form new explicit memories. Her doctor had to reintroduce  himself to her every time they met, because she couldn’t remember him from  day to day.  One day, as an experiment, the doctor hid a small sharp object in his hand when  he shook the patient’s hand in greeting.  When he followed up with her later, she had no explicit memory of meeting  him, and needed to be introduced to him yet again, but when he offered his  hand, she didn’t want to shake it, even though, when asked, she couldn’t give  any reason for her reluctance. This suggests that memories are processed in different ways, and that people  are not consciously aware of all their memories. What you know you know—The overlapping area (above) is your explicit mem- ory. You know it and you know you know it, and can talk about it, if needed. What you don’t know you know—The rest of the blue area is your tacit memory.   You know it, but couldn’t describe it in any detail, or talk about it in a meaning- ful way. Sometimes it is things you forgot you knew, and other times it is things  110 CHAPTER 4 HOW DO WE REMEMBER? that are encoded in memory without your conscious awareness. You don’t need  to be an amnesiac to have tacit knowledge. What you only think you know—The yellow area is made up of things you only  think you know, but when you try to use those bits, your knowledge is incom- plete or reconstructed incorrectly. Everybody has this—it’s part of the messy  human cognition process. Within these categories, there are many different types of memory. While we  are still very much in the process of understanding how different types of mem- ory work in the brain, some of the types of memory include: • Declarative or semantic memory. This is stuff you can talk about—facts,  principles or ideas, like WWII ending in 1945, or your zip code. • Episodic memory. This is also a form of declarative memory, but it’s speciﬁc  to stories or recollections from your own experience, like what happened at  your graduation, or when you started your ﬁrst job. • Conditioned memory. Like Pavlov’s dog, we all have conditioned reactions  to certain triggers, whether we realize it or not, like when a pet gets excited  about the sound of the can opener which precedes getting fed.  • Procedural memory. This is memory for how to perform procedures, like  driving a car or playing the piano. • Flashbulb memories. We seem to have a special type of memory for highly  emotionally charged events, like national catastrophes. Each of the different types of memory has different characteristics and differ- ent applications. DECLARATIVE OR SEMANTIC MEMORY Declarative memory is mostly the stuff you know you know, and can state  explicitly, like facts, principles, or ideas.  Sometimes it’s stuff you put into your closet deliberately (multiplication tables,  for example), and sometimes it’s material that you know despite not having  made any conscious effort to retain (everything I know about Britney Spears,  for example). 111 TYPES OF MEMORY EPISODIC MEMORY Episodic memory is also a form of declarative memory, in that you can talk  about it, but it’s related to speciﬁc events or experiences you’ve had.  For example, you may be able to remember a lot of things about dogs—they   are pets, they have four legs, they are furry, they eat dog food, Scooby-doo is   a dog, etc. But you also probably have episodic memories about speciﬁc dogs that you’ve  known—your childhood dog, the neighbor’s dog, or the scary dog that followed  you to school when you were little. 112 CHAPTER 4 HOW DO WE REMEMBER? STORYTELLING Episodic memory refers speciﬁcally to our memory for things that have happened  to us in our lives, but even when a particular story didn’t happen to us personally,  we seem to have a singular ability to remember stories.  At the beginning of their book Made to Stick, Chip and Dan Heath compare  two passages. The ﬁrst is an urban legend (a man meets a woman in a bar and  wakes up later in a bathtub full of ice with a kidney missing) and the second is  a paragraph about the return-on-investment rationale for non-proﬁt organiza- tions (or something like that).  A few years after reading the book, I can still remember several salient details  from the urban legend and nothing at all about the second passage. There are  multiple reasons why that’s the case, but a big part of it is because the ﬁrst pas- sage is a story.  There are a few reasons why stories seem to stick in our memories: We have a framework for stories. There’s a common framework for stories  that we’ve all learned from the ﬁrst stories we heard in childhood. Whether  we realize it or not, in each culture there are common elements that we expect  to hear when someone tells us a story. There’s a beginning, middle, and end.  There’s the setup, the introduction of the players, and the environment. There’s  The Point of the story, which is usually pretty easy to recognize when it comes  along. These are all shelves in our “how storytelling works” closet that give us  places to store the information as we encounter it. Stories are sequential. If I tell you 10 random facts about tennis, you need to  expend mental energy trying to organize those facts somehow, possibly group- ing like items or using some other strategy. If I tell you the story of a particularly  gripping tennis match with 10 signiﬁcant events, then the sequence of events  provides a lot of the organization for you. Additionally, there’s an internal logic  to events in stories (logically, dropping the carton of eggs can’t happen before  the trip to the grocery store in the story of having a bad day). Stories have characters. We have a lot of shelves to store information about  people, their personalities, and their characteristics. If the story is about people  we know, then we have all that background information to make remembering  easier, and we have expectations about how they will behave. And if the char- acter confounds your expectations by acting in a way that conﬂicts with your  assumptions, that is surprising and novel and subsequently more memorable. 113 TYPES OF MEMORY Which of the following would you be more interested in learning more about? A story about Jim, a teen who was injured in a car  accident, and how his family dealt  with the aftermath A story about Carla,  the new employee who  is the only one left in  the office when the vice  president calls down with  an emergency request for  updated reports A story about Marco,  the replacement hiring  manager in a company  currently being sued  for discriminatory  hiring practices Insurance procedures Steps to query a database  Human resources hiring best practices THIS? OR THIS? CONDITIONED MEMORY So you are cruising down the highway, and you glance in your rear view mirror  and see a police car right behind you. Pop quiz—what do you do? You slow down, right? Even if it becomes immediately apparent that the cop  isn’t the least bit interested in you, you’ve already dropped your speed, even if  you weren’t speeding in the ﬁrst place.  114 CHAPTER 4 HOW DO WE REMEMBER? What’s happening there? Probably you didn’t think to yourself, “Hmm, there  seems to be a police ofﬁcer behind me. Perhaps I should reduce my speed! I think  I’ll just gently let up on the gas pedal…easy does it…”  No, it was probably something more like, “WHOA!!” and you stomped your foot  on the brake. You see the stimulus of the police car, and you have what is a pretty much auto-  matic reaction to what you see. This is what is referred to as a conditioned response.  Our conditioned responses are a form of implicit memory. Somewhere, stored  in a part of your brain that you don’t necessarily have explicit access to, there’s  a formula like this: Everyone has reactions ingrained in their memory. Many are useful reactions  acquired either through unconscious association or through deliberate practice: 115 TYPES OF MEMORY Some actions didn’t need much effort to encode (like recoiling from a snake).  We acquire others deliberately, through practice and repetition. PROCEDURAL MEMORY Procedural memory is our memory for how to do things. Speciﬁcally, it’s our  memory for how to do things that require a step-by-step process.  Some of the procedures you know are consciously learned, and you can explic- itly state each step, but a lot of procedural memory is implicit.  Have you ever: • Known how to get somewhere, but been unable to give somebody directions  to that place? • Gotten all the way home on your daily drive from work and realized that you  have no memory of the drive itself? • Been unable to remember a phone number or a PIN without tapping it out on  the actual keypad? • Thought you explained all the steps for a task to someone and then realized  after it didn’t work that you had neglected to mention some crucial details? 116 CHAPTER 4 HOW DO WE REMEMBER? Those are all examples of utilizing something in your unconscious procedural  memory. You use repeated practice of a procedure to make it become an  unconscious habit. This is pretty important because it frees up your conscious  attention to do other things.  Do you remember when you were ﬁrst learning to drive? Everything required  effort and attention. Even if you were a pretty good student driver, you were still a bad driver,  because you had to pay so much attention to everything, until you acquired  enough practice to start automating some of the steps. Attention is a ﬁnite  resource, and new drivers spread it pretty thin. Fortunately they start automat- ing functions pretty quickly, and can then allocate a bigger chunk of their atten- tion to things like not crashing, or avoiding pedestrians. When you’ve been driving for a while, you (presumably) have freed up a lot of  your attention for other things besides the basic mechanics of driving, so you  can then, for example, change the radio station while switching lanes, and sing  along at the same time. Of course, you may still be a bad driver years later, but  that’s probably due to other issues.  Automated procedural memory is related to the idea of muscle memory which,  despite the name, is still really a brain function. Muscle memory refers to  your procedural memory for certain tasks where you have learned something  through practice so well that you don’t have to put any noticeable conscious  effort toward the task. You get muscle memory through practice, and more practice, and even more  practice (a process called overlearning). The biggest beneﬁt of this is that you  can perform the task without using up your conscious brain resources, freeing  up those resources for other things.  117 TYPES OF MEMORY It’s frequently difﬁcult to talk to others about these kinds of tasks, because you  didn’t learn them in a verbal, explicit way. You may know how to exactly adjust  your golf swing to account for wind conditions, but you may not be able to explain  it clearly to someone else. You can probably explain the overall motions, but not  the subtleties (timing, how much pressure, the feel when you know it’s correct). FLASHBULB MEMORY A few years ago, a freeway bridge near my home collapsed during rush hour,  causing the death of about a dozen people, and injuring over a hundred more.   It was widely reported in the national media at the time.  I vividly remember where I was when I heard about it. I was in a meeting room  at the ofﬁce working on a conference proposal. The lights were dim, and one  of the cleaning people came in and told me about the bridge. I remember what  chair I was sitting in, all the details of the proposal I was working on, and which  website I used to get more information about the incident. This type of vivid memory for emotionally charged events is call flashbulb  memory. It’s common for people to be able to recollect exactly where they   were when they heard about the September 11th terrorist attacks, for example.  So what is the cause of this type of memory, and what does it have to do with  learning? (Not that staging a major newsworthy event is a practical way to  encourage retention.) Many believe that ﬂashbulb memory developed as part of our brain’s attempt  to keep us alive.  118 CHAPTER 4 HOW DO WE REMEMBER? If you survive a death-defying encounter, you want to remember how you did it.   Remembering how you got away from the bear is a much higher survival priority  than remembering where you left that rock. You can forget all sorts of day-to- day things without dying, but if you bump into a bear a second time, forgetting  key information from your ﬁrst encounter may get you killed. Ordinarily, it takes time, effort, and repetition to get things into your long-term  memory, but in emotionally charged circumstances, the ﬂoodgates open and  take in everything in the timeframe around the event. Sometimes it seems like  time stands still. Things you can  forget and not die Things that can  kill you 119 REPETITION AND MEMORY One theory about why time seems to slow in an emergency is that you just  remember so much more from those harrowing seconds than you do from the  same amount of time in a normal circumstance. (Stetson 2007) Even though I have never been personally harmed or threatened by an event like  a bridge collapse or a terrorist attack, the heightened emotional charge of just  hearing about the event seems to be enough to enhance my memory.  Even in less dire circumstances, emotion seems to have an impact on how much  we remember. We will revisit this idea in later chapters and look at speciﬁc meth- ods for using emotion to enhance retention. REPETITION AND MEMORY With a few exceptions, learning almost always requires practice and repetition.  For some reason, these are some of the most neglected aspects of learning  design. Ever heard a variation on this conversation? First supervisor:     The staff is still throwing away the empty  cartridges. Second supervisor:   But I know we told them not to. See, it’s the  third bullet point on slide 22 of the training  presentation.  120 CHAPTER 4 HOW DO WE REMEMBER? When you learn something new, connections are formed between neurons in  your brain. Like the paths that gradually develop when people repeatedly walk over the  same ground, the connections that form in the brain are strengthened and   reinforced whenever a learner re-encounters the material. Connections that are reinforced become stronger and more durable. And, like a  path that sees dwindling trafﬁc, connections that aren’t reinforced will usually  fade or become irretrievable. Repetition and practice are necessary to success- fully retain most learning for the long term. Also, it’s important for a learning designer to ﬁgure out how to have reinforce- ment without resorting to monotonous repetition. We know that multiple   exposures to an idea improve the likelihood that the idea will be retained (well  and good). BUT (and this is a big but) habituation tells us that people also tune  out repetitive, unchanging things.  121 REPETITION AND MEMORY In the later design chapters, we look at how to reinforce an idea while avoiding  tedious repetition.  MEMORIZATION: THE BLUNT FORCE SOLUTION So if repetition is so critical, why is memorizing stuff such a pain in the ass?  Should we just get tough and use lots and lots or repetition to grind that infor- mation into people’s heads? When I was in college, I took an architecture class. The professor was  explaining about early church buildings. She explained the people building  the churches wanted to make the buildings as tall as possible, because they  believed high ceilings enhanced churchgoers’ religious feeling. There were two different ways, the professor said, to make a building really tall:  Use clever engineering to support the walls, or just make the walls really thick. Using pure memorization to grind something into a learner’s brain is the equiva- lent of building really thick walls—yes, it works, but it takes a lot of resources,  and it’s a clunky solution.  The biggest problem with memorization through repetition is that it frequently  puts the information on just one shelf: When you learn something by using it in context, you put it on multiple shelves,  and learn how to use that information in multiple contexts. 122 CHAPTER 4 HOW DO WE REMEMBER? So basically, if you repeat something over and over, eventually you will wear  a groove into your long-term memory, but there are some limitations to that  approach. • It’s only on one shelf (basically the “stuff I memorized” shelf), which gives  you only one place to look when you are trying to retrieve the information.  • You don’t have experience using it in multiple contexts, so it’s more difﬁcult  to take that information and transfer it to a variety of situations.  • You likely have sequential rather than random access to the information.  If you learn something in a memorized sequence, then the context for that  information is in that sequence, and your ability to retrieve it is also in that  sequence. You probably have to tick through the list every time you need to  retrieve something, which is much slower than being able to get directly to  that item.  SUMMARY • Memory relies on encoding and retrieval, so learning designers need to   think about how the material gets into long-term memory, and also what   the learner can do to retrieve it later. • Learners are besieged with a constant ﬂow of input, and things need to be  signiﬁcant to the learner to attract their attention. • People habituate to monotonous stimuli, so learning design needs to not fall  into a repetitive drone.  • Working memory has its limits, and it’s easy to overwhelm a new learner.  Limit or chunk the ﬂow of new information to make it more manageable. • People hold items in working memory only as long as they need them for  some purpose. Once that purpose is satisﬁed, they frequently forget the  items. Asking your learners to do something with the information causes  them to retain it longer and increases the likelihood that that information   will be encoded into long-term memory. • The organization of long-term memory has an impact on a learner’s ability   to retrieve material. The material will be easier to retrieve if it is grounded in   a rich context and accessible in multiple ways (i.e., on multiple shelves).  123 SUMMARY • Matching the emotional context of learning to the emotional context of  retrieval improves the likelihood that the learner will be able to successfully  use the material.  • Storytelling leverages an existing mental framework, and therefore information  given in story forms can be easier to retain than other types. • Repetition and memorization will work to encode information into long-term  memory, but it’s a limited strategy. This process can be tedious for learners  and doesn’t provide very many pathways for retrieval. • There are many different types of memory, and utilizing multiple types can  improve the likelihood material is retained.
