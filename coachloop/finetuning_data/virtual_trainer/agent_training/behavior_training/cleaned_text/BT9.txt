Their gift to us comes in the written reflections and interviews in which  they gave serious thought to that experience in order to articulate what they made  of it and how it then played a role—of many different sorts—in their own lives. At  the same time these classes and projects have given me over the last twenty some  years a set of colleagues, fellow researchers, and beloved friends that I can never  thank enough. In its early years the style of community engagement sketched  here took shape in written and in-person conversations with colleagues, the likes  of Eli Goldblatt, Ellen Cushman, Steve Parks, Paula Mathieu, David Coogan—as  we supported, challenged, and learned from each other’s practice. The bibliogra­ phy is my larger thank-you note. For me, it all started with Wayne Peck, Elenore Long, and Lorraine Higgins  who brought the Community Literacy Center vision to life and whose own writing  has been a gift to our field. And to Mrs. Joyce Baskins for her laughing, wise and  loving support to all of us. Wayne as director of the Community House brought  not only his vision, but an on-the-ground ability to bring it to life. Lorraine not  only invented the CLC’s Argue project, but even took on the job of center director.  Elenore’ gift for listening shaped our approach to mentoring, which blossomed  into the theory and practice of a “responsive rhetorical art” in her research and  leadership. This collaboration and my colleagues’ sense of adventure, imagination,  caring and social commitment was the wellspring for the best we accomplished.  (As CMU’s founder, Andrew Carnegie, put it in 1900, “My heart is in the work.”) This work has been supported at various times by the OERI (Office of Edu­ cational Research and Improvement) through National Center for the Study of  Writing at Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon and my colleagues Sarah Freedman  and Glynda Hull. My happy collaboration with John R. (Dick) Hayes in cognitive  psychology laid the foundation for what I brought from cognitive rhetoric and  problem-solving to the CLC agenda. And from the beginning Pittsburgh’s How­ ard Heinz and Grable Foundations, and Carnegie Mellon supported both our  research and what were often unusual projects.  Over these years many students have not only contributed to this work, but  have helped shape/reshape its vision and practices. To name just a few, I would  thank Alex Helberg, Craig Moreau, Julia Bennett, Jimmy Lizama, Cody Januszko,  Maggie Goss, Ryan Roderick, Maureen Mathison, Ryan Mitchell, Emily Dejeu  Tim Dawson, Justin Mando, Lindsey Wotanis, Alyssa Fogel, Susan Swan, Maria  Poznahovska, Jessica Heathcote, Elizabeth Wolff, and Ann Blakeslee. Christopher  Brown, Audrey Strohm, Ana Cooke, Brad Walker, and Leslie Setlock. viii   Acknowledgments On the journey the book itself took, I have had the most generous, insightful,  and delightful group of traveling companions I could have ever wished for. The  imprint of fresh ideas and personal support from Doug Cloud, Amanda Berar­ di Tennant, Derek Handley, Carolyn Commer, and Mary Glavan is to be found  across these pages. Elenore Long’s own work and wonderful advice—though  multiple versions of this manuscript—has been a guiding light to me. This MS  reflects not only her thoughtful reading/re-reading but even more her insight  into how we can build connections with others. And if such friendship is not  enough, I guess she actually deserves some credit for sharing with me her off­ spring, Pascale Jarvis,  who has been one of the best, most thoughtful MS editors  I have had the pleasure to work with. Heather Falconer, Associate Publisher at the WAC Clearinghouse seemed to  answer all my questions, guide my next steps—and turn everything around over­ night. Dan Donahue’s copyediting had a great eye for detail. Mike Palmquist,  Founding Editor and Publisher, lived up to his remarkable reputation as an in­ ventor of new ways of publishing that has made work in education so widely  available. And from the beginning, he seemed to know exactly what I wanted to  do, set us on the path, and gave me the sort of encouragement that lighted the  way. I am so happy to be working with this team. OUTCOMES OF ENGAGED  EDUCATION: FROM TRANSFER  TO TRANSFORMATION 3 Introduction How This Book Started The stories, observations and arguments you will read here owe their inspiration  to an early morning walk with Wayne Peck at a 1998 American Educational Re­ search Association Conference in San Diego. Wayne had chosen to use his M.Div.  from Harvard to pastor a small, interracial, progressive church in Pittsburgh’s  urban Northside as well as wrap up his PhD in rhetoric at Carnegie Mellon. At  this point, I was engaged with equal enthusiasm in how to turn the research, my  colleague in psychology Dick (John. R.) Hayes and I had named “cognitive rheto­ ric,” into “teachable” heuristics—strategies that our “expert” writers were showing  us but our “novices” didn’t seem to know. I had made a start with a textbook on  problem-solving strategies for writing. However, in that cool early morning air in San Diego, Wayne Peck made a re­ mark that opened up a whole new path in my life. As he said, “You know, for all your  CMU students are learning, they will succeed anyway, with or without greater skill  in writing. But for the black and white inner-city teenagers in my neighborhood,  being able to communicate in more public ways might make all the difference.” Somehow, despite growing up in Kansas and small-town Iowa, I knew he was  right. And somehow, by that fall, we had invented the Community Literacy Cen­ ter, joined forces with Ms. Joyce Baskins (a recognized African American advo­ cate and “mother of the neighborhood” in Pittsburgh’s Northside), and created  a college course in literacy that combined reading in theory, research and social  action in order to mentor a group of urban teenage writers. And we all learned a  lot. Each semester a Community Literacy Center project took on an issue those  teenagers were facing, from risk and respect, to stress, to gangs, to finding jobs, to  police, which they explored in their own publishable newsletter and then drama­ tized and presented in a public Community Conversation to engage the audience  in discussing the issues these teenagers knew so well. This story is a good example of what is now being called “co-creation.” In a  review of Aimée Knight’s argument for this practice in her Community is the Way,  Christopher Castillo sketches three guiding principles for community based  partnerships: 1) focus on communities’ strengths and assets, 2) prioritize co-cre­ ation of knowledge with partners, and 3) work towards change in the process of  community work (153). This is how we also described it at the time: The design and staffing of the CLC reflects its intercultural  agenda which invites people to cross boundaries of race, age,  class, and gender. Along with the present authors, Joyce Baskins  brings 20 years of community activism to her advocacy for Af­ rican-American youth. Donald Tucker brings experience as a  4   Introduction jazz musician and construction foreman to engaging inner-city  youth in designing community development videos, Elenore  Long, a post-doctoral fellow . . . brings her research on literacy  and social action, . . . and Kevin McCartan brings know-how in  grassroots community development and construction to CLC  projects (Peck, Flower, and Higgins 221). One of the distinctive features of this program was that although our teenage  writers may not have been models of “success” at doing school, here they were tak­ ing literate action, writing about real, often unspoken challenges they faced in their  neighborhoods. When they walked into the Center to talk and write, they were the  undisputed “experts.” And the mentors from my class, who were identified as “Sup­ porters,” were just that. What we “taught” were strategies drawn from our research  for problem-solving and decision-making, not simply for planning and revising but  what for turned out to be our three most powerful strategies for inquiry: getting  at the “Story-Behind-The-Story,” digging out “Rival Interpretations,” and explor­ ing “Options and Outcomes.” Each writer’s Supporter then encouraged, challenged  and helped Writers think through how to turn their insights into an effective text.  That is, how to make teachers, administrators, even police officers who came to the  Community Conversations or read their newsletters see their world a little differ­ ently. (A measure of success I always treasured was the angry high school English  teacher who came up to me at a Conversation, to accuse us of making her newly  confident student “think he could write.” Apparently, we had different standards. As director of Pittsburgh’s Community House, Wayne Peck brought a his­ torical perspective to this work. Founded in 1916 at the height of the settlement  house movement, with its classrooms, kitchens, offices, gym, and swimming  pool, Community House was designed to be a “place of connection,” to create a  “light house of education” for urban neighborhoods” (Peck et al. 201). For him,  “the CLC seeks to reinvent the settlement house vision of community and univer­ sity interaction, but this time with attention centered on collaborative problem  solving and the appreciation of multiple kinds of expertise” (203). His account of  Mark captures this kind of engagement. A bright and resourceful teenager, who like many African-Amer­ ican males, finds little that interests him in school and is fre­ quently suspended. . . . A fifteen-year-old at a crossroads. . . . In  a recent CLC project, for example, Mark and ten other teens  used writing to investigate the reasons for the increase in school  suspension in the public schools. To present this “policy paper”  Mark and his peers organized a “community conversation” with  the mayor, the media, the school board president, principals,  and community residents, in which Mark performed a rap writ­ ten from a teen’s perspective and his peers interpreted it for the  audience. As the culmination of their eight-week project, the  Introduction   5 teens also presented a newsletter, “Whassup with Suspension,”  which has since become required reading for teachers and stu­ dents in Mark’s high school. (199-200) Over the next 20 years this start-up drew in undergrad and graduate students.  As non-profits do it morphed into new projects and research in new cities led by  folks like Elenore Long and Lorraine Higgins. Many of these are referenced in the  discussion, but the cases here will draw on my own experience. My own learning  curve, later as a director of the university’s Center for Community Outreach but  more importantly as an ordinary college professor, led to new courses and different  projects with nursing aides, welfare recipients, and “at-risk” freshmen, on prob­ lems emerging in organizations, colleges, universities, unions, and high schools. In  search of outcomes of engaged education, this book will draw on various kinds of  data from this series of projects at the CLC and Carnegie Mellon University. One of these projects, Decision Makers, was designed with an innovative high  school program for juniors and seniors with a learning disability. Coming to the  Carnegie Mellon campus computer lab, these “Scholars” created a personal Journey  Book about their own good, bad, and future decisions, while their Supporters, in my  course on Literacy: Educational Theory and Community Practice, helped draw out  their Scholar’s own insight and expertise. A Decision Makers computer program  we designed embedded their now easily publishable writing within an online guide  with prompts and questions based on the same strategies developed at the CLC. As  an added bonus, it allowed us to collect an on-going body of pre/post data on the  changes in their “Reflective Decision Making” discussed in Chapter 3. A second set of projects created a series of Community Think Tanks, visited  in Chapters 2, 3, and 5. Students in my seminar on Leadership, Dialogue and  Change organized their Community Think Tank around a campus or community  issue. Collecting alternative, and often competing, representations of the problem  and of options and outcomes from a variety of stakeholders, they then created  a  Briefing Book sent to all participants. The booklet prepared them for the prob­ lem-solving dialogues in a series of Round Table discussions, the results of which  the students documented, and published online (www.cmu.edu/thinktank, ac­ cessed 4 April 2024). (See Chapter 2, Figure 2.1) So these chapters grew out of my experience over 25 years with the folks in  the CLC, Decision Makers, and the Community Think Tanks. It was these people  with whom I was privileged to work who provide the substance and the insights  of this book. And it was thinking back over those events, stories, and data we  had collected, that I was struck with the significance of what they were doing with  what they learned. And this became my motivation to go back and ask, what were  the outcomes for them? Doing so revealed not only distinctive examples of trans­ fer, but remarkable instances of transformation in which former college students  and community writers rewrote and adapted that experience into significantly  personal outcomes. Yet at the same time it was striking how little our standard  6   Introduction methods of assessment look beyond the college classroom (and sometime intern­ ships). In particular, how little we know about the life outcomes for the students  who took part in community engaged education. A Particular Model of Engagement This story has its own niche in the robust culture and history of community en­ gagement. Its model of engagement can start with faculty who, like myself may  have multiple relations to community engagement, but who have also had the op­ portunity to teach college courses with high expectations for intellectual engage­ ment with theory and research (in my case in rhetoric, inquiry, social justice, and  public deliberation) with students who are equally eager to become Supporters,  dealing with challenging problems, in relationships across difference in which the  community “Partner” is the knowledge expert. That’s a long sentence but those  interconnections are what make this such a fertile ground for learning. Here the  college student must deal with many of the issues raised in the historical path  from service to educational engagement—issues that involve collaborative rela­ tionships, reciprocity, positionality, on the one hand, and various forms of action  for social justice, on the other—always in the context of a unique and unpredict­ able setting where success is never guaranteed. To be more explicit, this book will explore a particular form of community  engaged education. As an educational practice for college students, it creates a  dialogue in which academic research and theory is not only studied but then  embedded and tested in a community experience raising the challenge of deal­ ing with difference. In this context of intercultural engagement students draw on  a conceptual framework, sketched above, designed to support rhetorical praxis  through action and reflection. With the goal of developing working knowledge  based on inquiry and metacognitive understanding, the educational outcome for  these students lies in whether and how this knowledge is adapted and applied in  their lives beyond the classroom and college.  Working out of this paradigm for community engaged education, my goals are •	 To explore our potential to make an even stronger case for engaged edu­ cation (given what has been called a “crisis in the humanities”) by docu­ menting its outcomes. •	 To expand our understanding of transfer beyond the classroom to reveal  the even more powerful acts of knowledge transformation we are seeing. •	 And, finally to consider new methods for tracking, assessing and giving  public presence to the outcomes of engaged education. What Can This Book Offer? Privileged for over 25 years with this sort of educational engagement, I found I  had amassed a collection of varied revealing accounts of outcomes students have  Introduction   7 seen for themselves. Unlike attitude surveys, they were chiefly designed not only  to improve my own classes, but as a concluding assignment that would draw my  students into the reflective inquiry that can transform learning. Each chapter will  then describe: •	 A particular kind of outcome, illustrated with a case study from these  documents, •	 And a non-experimental, teacher-based method we can use with our stu­ dents to track their transfer and transformations, and to document those  outcomes, •	 Ending with a brief account of what we observed in our particular con­ texts using that method. The final chapter describes some heuristics for introducing a framework for  reflection, knowing that reflection on one’s own practice will open the door to  personal agency and deeper learning. It then reviews some ways students can  carry out this inquiry themselves. In the same spirit in which each chapter makes  a distinction between a method and what we ourselves observed, I want to em­ phasize how these methods can be adapted to the wide range of situations and  goals different teachers will have.

From a historical perspective, those terms can call to mind the broad  change in academic culture that has united both the institutional outreach and  the curriculum of colleges and universities with different communities and their  8   Introduction needs. Looking back, there was obviously the long tradition of volunteerism  and community service that spawned “service-learning” more generally. But it  wasn’t until the 1980s that it became the subject of research and assessment in  education and educational psychology. In Alan S. Waterman’s detailed though  dated review, these “experiential learning” and “community-service learning pro­ grams” were only lightly connected to a curriculum and were assessed in terms  of simple results (increased school attendance or grades) and holistic measures of  attitudes. In 1985 “public service” gained status and visibility when the four pres­ idents of Brown, Stanford, Georgetown, and the Education Commission of the  States co-founded the non-profit Campus Compact to showcase the good work  their students were doing. (By 2000 it had 700 member campuses.) In1984 Ernest  Boyer’s influential Carnegie Reports (written as President of the Carnegie Foun­ dation) began proposing a new paradigm of scholarship that would integrate,  communicate, and apply knowledge through professional service. But the sea change relevant here came when the practice of “service” was re­ written into “community collaboration” or “engaged education” in the academic  field of writing, rhetoric, and communication studies. In 1989, Pittsburgh’s Com­ munity House and Carnegie Mellon founded the Community Literacy Center.  (As far as we knew, this was the first use of the particular term “community liter­ acy.”) The year 2000 saw the first issue of Reflections, in which its opening review  of the previous ten years, announced both the enormous popularity of service  learning and the confusion over what actually was (Adler-Kassner 28). In the same year, Tom Deans’ ground-breaking study, Writing Partner­ ships: Service-Learning in Composition, defined the purview of this new aca­ demic field as writing for community, writing about community, and writing  with community. In the same year, the Conference on College Composition  and Communication named a new special session for it. Later in the fall of  2021 the first issue of the Community Literacy Journal appeared. The lead arti­ cle in that first issue was on the CLC. It was also the focus of Dean’s chapter  on “writing with” (two of his three recommended sources also came from the  CLC). Back in 1998 the WAC Clearinghouse had opened its doors as an on- line, open-access publishing collaborative with contributions from more than  200 scholars from six continents. Although WAC is a standard bearer for writ­ ing in multiple disciplines and technology, it now offers access to 4,240 re­ sources on service learning, 3,230 on community literacy, and 2,120 on com­ munity engagement. Obviously, there will be overlap in these lists, but again  they signal the growing breadth of interest in community related scholarship. This new academic community began to call its work by various names, from  community literacy and collaboration to self-publishing, to public pedagogy, to  civic, social, and educational engagement among others. It had moved from uni­ versity-initiated outreach, to local, individual initiatives with nonprofits, from  collaboratively designed projects and programs to expanding networks of groups.  Moreover, if we look at the first issues of those new journals, from their beginning  Introduction   9 the context, sites, scope and concerns of this movement ranged from writing in  the context of the first-year college experience, public housing, and communi­ ty-based technological literacy programs, to analyzing labor market connections,  designing writing centers, and sustaining woman-centered programs. Now, 25  years later, we are entering an even more heightened level of political engagement  and critique, focused on racism and discrimination, and calls to act for social  justice. From the beginning, the scope of the new model of community engagement  was remarkably broad, followed over the last 25 years by a continued expansion  of its public visibility, funding and academic significance. In WAC, the clearing­ house for writing across the disciplines, community-linked research turns up  across its sites, from professional writing to nursing to technical communication.  As Ann Blakeslee and her colleagues note in “A Story of a Writing-Based Re­ source—and a Call to Engage” even “technical communication has made tremen­ dous strides in enacting a social justice agenda . . . [which is] accountable to our  communities and their members” (42). By the time of Eli Goldbatt, Steve Parks,  and David Jolliffe’s landmark 2008 Imagining Community Literacy Symposium,  we were being called to increasingly public action by models of social activism  and community publishing such as Steve Parks and Eli Goldblatt’s New City  Writing and Steve Parks New City Community Press and David Coogan’s 2006  work for social change through community action and later prison writing. Now  in a quick look through our journals and conferences, community engagement is  even more emphatically focused on social justice. However, as we will discuss in Chapter 1, our understanding of educa­ tional outcomes and the practice of assessing them is still somewhat murky. Al­ though it goes beyond the measurement of community members’ competency  in reading and writing that dominated early outreach programs, the assessment  of their college mentors is largely dependent on broad holistic evaluation and  attitude assessments. For example, a recent study using multiple sophisticated  research methods, is giving us an expanded view of the broad outcomes of com­ munity-based engagement for college students. They conclude it “has been con­ nected to increases in civic attitudes and civic mindedness; civic and community  engagement, including increased value of engaging with the community” which  includes feeling both the value of engagement and its social responsibility and  obligation (Chittum et al. 16). However, they point out, although the research has  expanded, “higher education still has much to learn about the efficacy of commu­ nity-based experiences” (16). We have work to do. 11 Chapter 1. Why Should  Assessment Matter? Walking across campus to my office, I pass the well-endowed computer sci­ ence complex and the new fine arts building. On the sidewalk, red inlays dis­ play the names of faculty and students in the performing arts who have taken  home Emmy, Oscar, Grammy, and Tony awards over the years. The lampposts  that line the sidewalk are likewise decorated with banners celebrating the accom­ plishments of my colleagues with photos of them in their labs, where they test a  robot or write calculations on the board. The banner titles herald these faculty as  “The Innovators.” As you might guess, the award winners are primarily in science,  engineering, information systems, or the high-profile performing arts. A recent  email from our new president celebrated a leadership appointment in Marketing  and Communications that will “highlight our breadth and depth in scholarship,  education and societal impact” (emphasis added). All these symbolic messages illustrate the value we place on visible outcomes  that have equally visible social impact. A more familiar parallel message in our  own field, journals, and departments, however, is likely to note that the liberal  arts are in crisis—or to be more precise, face being rendered obsolete, irrelevant  to new realities, and underfunded in an age of austerity. And it raises the ques­ tion: How do we point out our visible outcomes and societal impact? I hear John  Dewey insisting that the meaning and worth of the ideas and practices we teach  reside in the consequences of holding those ideas. And in the outcomes. Socially Engaged Education Our field, especially the committed educators referenced here, has long been  working to make a case for many sorts of community engagement. Appearing in  rhetoric, communication, composition, and English journals, the proposed re­ sponses to the question of our worth can range from assertively defending the  scholarly status quo to instead calling us to engage with a public on its own terms  around its felt dilemmas. The particular focus of my contribution here will be on  a form of engagement that ties the serious study of rhetoric and learning to local­ ly-engaged action—a kind of learning not defined by the acquisition of familiar  bodies of knowledge, but by the construction and use of productive knowledge  that is measured by outcomes. And a focus, in particular, on a still rare form of  assessment based on actual outcomes for the engaged college student. This chapter starts by sketching a particular paradigm of community-based  socially engaged learning emerging in rhetorical studies and educational research:  a paradigm in which an explicit goal of education is both judgment and wise ac­ tion (based on what rhetoric describes as phronésis, or practical wisdom). Here  12   Chapter 1 the product of learning includes situated knowledge, and evaluation is based on  the test of transfer beyond the classroom. Within this paradigm, we begin to see  the unique educational value of courses that can draw students into a purpose­ ful engagement with public issues, community interests, exigencies, and people.  When students begin to take this engaged stance toward their own learning, they  move toward the goals Linda Adler-Kassner and Peggy O’Neill set for the field:  “We . . . must learn how to communicate our knowledge effectively beyond our  own discipline and specialties so we can affect the discussions being held in state  legislatures, departments of education, corporate boards, public commissions,  and public forums” (qtd. in Welch 703). Such learning, I would add, also includes  how to listen for and understand those needs. In her excellent analysis of the public turn in composition, Ashley Holmes  shows why it has emerged as such a powerful model of community engagement.  Public Pedagogy in Composition Studies lays out a probing introduction to Henry  Giroux and his “critical analysis” of the neo-liberal logic of our culture that pro­ motes consumerism and individualism. In response, Holmes’ case study research  shows us ways “public pedagogy” can also allow students to enter and “engage pub­ lic spaces as a method of analysis and critique” (13). The “spatial shock” of entering  those spaces can not only reveal social-produced assumptions but trigger reflection  on our own positionality (25). Nevertheless, as Phyllis Ryder argues, “the university  [also] operates in a space saturated with neoliberal justifications for its purpose: to  boost the economy, to create good workers, and to create its ‘products’ efficiently”  (qtd. in Holmes 16-17). Recognizing that the problem is not just “out there,” is one  reason the notion of “location” and the “relocation” of the classroom has gained  prominence. As John Ackerman and David Coogan’s The Public Work of Rhetoric  makes explicit, that work “is not shaped in our treatises and classrooms alone but  in the material and discursive histories of communities outside of academe” (1-2). Nevertheless, giving social significance a central place in a liberal curriculum  will face two hurdles. First, if we attend to Dewey’s insistence that the meaning of  an idea resides in the consequences of holding that idea, then we must be able to  articulate and show what those consequences are. How do we understand, much  less track, those outcomes in which learning is measured not by tests and papers,  but by rhetorical praxis: socially situated inquiry, dialogue, reflection and action? Second, to complicate this agenda, a focus on outcomes has taken on a new,  politically loaded meaning in contemporary education. “Outcomes” has been ap­ propriated as the God-word of a neoliberal agenda designed to produce (and  selectively subsidize) quantifiable, marketable skills as defined by the corporate  sector and the ever-growing educational assessment industry.1  1.	  To put this market-based approach to education in a historical context, Carolyn  Commer’s gripping study of the  controversy raised by the 2005 Spellings Commission  report tracks the heated reception of the Department of Education’s attempt to increase  “accountability” in higher education. The red flag that aroused educators was not only this  Why Should Assessment Matter?   13   Nancy Welch and Tony Scott’s edited collection Composition in the Age of  Austerity offers us competing arguments for how our field should respond to this  “felt sense of crisis . . . in writing education” (4). In a review of those essays, David  Grant notes how some of the most vigorous critiques reveal the engine of neolib­ eralism at work, actively shaping “how policy has changed to reward outcomes  rather than inputs, where the educational emphasis on outcomes is typically  placed in opposition to ‘experience’” (12). To be more specific, experience is a  valued outcome in a neoliberal education when it is transferrable to a marketable  work experience. And those institutional forces that control cuts in funding, staff,  and courses devalue any effort to create a traditional, if somewhat unspecified,  “broadening experience” by asking instead for indicators of success that can be  measured by assessment. So here’s the rub: The assessment these institutions have  in mind is based on functionalist measures associated with the neoliberal prem­ ise Scott describes as “the embedded commonsense principle that most spheres  of human life are better perceived, managed, and evaluated as markets” (qtd. in  Grant 8). Fortunately, that is not the only way to play this game. Deborah Mutnick’s  response to austerity calls us to “address these problems through on-going work  . . . [that can] reclaim assessment and perform it on our own terms” (qtd. in  Welch and Scott 40). I think of this as a call for grounded-theory building in  which we must create both an expanded image of what we are after (an expanded  theory of knowledge) and the methods to recognize it. This image, philosopher  Sandra Harvey argues, makes a difference: it “answers questions about who can  be a ‘knower’ . . . what tests beliefs must pass in order to be legitimated as knowl­ edge . . . [and] what kinds of things can be known” (qtd. in Shah 14). Imagine, for  example, an expanded image of knowledge, its knowers and its tests that might  recognize the standing of local, rural, impoverished or indigenous knowers, and  their experiential, cultural, situated knowledge. It might include a grasp of things  a feminist science would see as having alternative evidence-based explanations. Some Problems with Assessment A different criticism of our current assessment tools comes from Aimée Knight’s  recent argument for an asset-based assessment approach to community devel­ opment, that is, one focused on strengths rather than the community’s deficits  or on problems the institutional partner sets out to “solve.” Like Adrienne Maree  attempt at control, but its basis in a “market discourse.” In Championing a Public Good: A  Call to Advocate for Higher Education, Commer explores a revealing repertoire of argu­ ment strategies that shaped this still unfinished argument (e.g., from dissociating quality  from the market measures of quantity,  to framing desired outcomes in terms of  ethical  values as opposed to technical expertise). At stake is the contest between a managerial  frame for assessment versus the academic and humanistic values that support the public  good in a deliberative democracy. 14   Chapter 1 Brown, Knight prioritizes the slow work of building relationships versus critical  mass. In her rich presentation of strategies and tools for building truly reciprocal  relations, she argues that our current methods of evaluation put the university’s  gains (publications, grants, even student learning outcomes) over “communi­ ty-building.” (22). So in developing community partnerships she proposes three  guiding principles: 1) focus on communities’ strengths and assets, 2) prioritize  co-creation of knowledge with partners, and 3) work towards change in the pro­ cess of community work. (16) . And in her assessment of students, what matters is  whether they are prepared to participate in civic life as “agents of social change”  (49). She notes a pre/post survey that asked if the experience motivated them to  subsequent community engagement and action, “more that 80% of students felt  the experience ‘greatly influenced their attitudes and beliefs about their capacity  to create change’” (88). Did they do so? In that spirit, the present study explores an alternative image of assessment  based on cases that will let us test drive a variety of alternative assessment meth­ ods. First of all, such an image locates the meaning of the ideas one learns as John  Dewey does: in the consequences of holding them, which will in turn demand a  much more situated assessment of outcomes. Secondly, this Deweyan image of  assessment captures a distinctive intellectual capacity that is best learned through  communal activity. This is not to say that such capacities would not be “mar­ ketable,” but Dewey’s end-in-view is an education designed for citizenship. Such  an education demands “a clear consciousness of a communal life” and activities  “whose consequences are appreciated as . . . a good shared by all” (The Public  and its Problems 149). The “training for citizenship,” he observes, “is formal and  nominal unless it develops the power of observation, analysis, and inference with  respect to what makes up a social situation and the agencies through which it  is modified” (“Ethical Principles” 127). Finally, by tracking the consequences of  engagement at a more cognitive level, this image of assessment reveals some sig­ nificant outcomes that are not limited to the direct transfer of knowledge, but as  we will see, can entail students’ transformation of that knowledge in response to  emerging personal and community concerns. Engaged education has a unique potential to fuse civic and social, personal  and intellectual outcomes into an expansive version of the humanities. Discov­ ering more ways to track these consequences of publicly engaged learning can,  I believe, offer a new road map and tools in our search for public significance of  the liberal arts in its “crisis.” Helping build such a case is the focus of this study. Making the Case for Engaged Education For some, this engaged image, which extends what matters in the humanities, will  seem perhaps too constraining compared to an unfettered life of the mind. In an  impassioned defense of traditional scholarship, Kathleen McConnell’s argument  celebrates the freedom of academic professionals to do “academic inquiry [that]  Why Should Assessment Matter?   15   serves rhetorical invention by acting as a placeholder for the unknown,” which  is expressed, as she defines it, as “endless gestures toward unspecified possibility”  (52-53). This stance, she notes, is a clear departure “from more civic-minded, prag­ matic notions [of invention] such as the one Hartelius seeks to revive . . . [through  training] in rhetorical strategies” (52). E. Johanna Hartelius, to whom McCon­ nell refers, does indeed define higher education’s problem as precisely its lack of  “relevance and responsiveness to societal exigencies” (153). Explicitly concerned  with pedagogy, Hartelius argues that academic “silos” and the critical orientation  that dominates education (focused on the “critical” analysis of texts and their  ideology) won’t prepare students to actually intervene as social agents. Hartelius’  alternative builds on a rhetoric of classical invention and contemporary inquiry,  situated in a “climate of exigency” (162). Here, in contrast to traditional acquisi­ tion, learning is shot through with uncertainty and ambiguity. In this situated and  social space, students must build bridges between academic and lived knowledge.  To deal with the problems this demand for inquiry and invention poses, her stu­ dents are cast “as the agents of education” (171). From a somewhat different perspective rooted in a feminist analysis of advo­ cacy and leadership, Jane Detwiler, Margaret LaWare, and Patricia Wojahn ar­ gue that this elevation of scholarship (which privileges elite institutions) and the  concomitant devaluation of teaching, much less “service,” is a gendered choice.  Their alternative vision of disciplinary leadership exhorts our field to create inter­ disciplinary collaborations with schools and community organizations. Even our  graduate programs, some argue, “should be attending to the collaborative skills  needed to build community-based research programs” (Miller and Murray 437). The demand for an engaged education is raised a notch when we look at the  situations students will face. Carolyn Commer’s study of the Spellings controver­ sy gives us an impressively actionable account of what “public-facing leadership”  could look like when we choose to enter, as she says, “education policy-making,  with the goal of helping those in higher education create new pathways for public  engagement . . . [when we take] a participant approach to policy theory” (Shaping  Policy 21). To do that, our students must be prepared to deal with the fact “that  most education policy problems are fundamentally rhetorical problems. . . . be­ cause they are marked by uncertainty and require people to use language to ap­ peal to particular audiences, to discover shared values, and to invite others to take  particular actions that have material consequences” (Championing 4). Garret Stack shows us how such mediation must work in environmental edu­ cation, training students to become “transformative public advocates.” To do this  means working as “knowledge negotiators” facing a wide variety of arguments  while at the same time drawing the public into “addressing conflict and re-fram­ ing a shared problem” (Stack and Flower 3). In an extensive review of the “crisis discourse” in the liberal arts, Timothy  Barouch and Brett Ommen pose the problem as a long-standing question of  identity: Is rhetoric a critical discipline or a practical art? If the former, is its  16   Chapter 1 current version (which they say identifies scholarship with the discourse of a  “negative critical stance”) actually equipping students to negotiate “liberal public  culture” (164)? Speaking from communication studies, they dissect the recent  “genre of ‘defenses of a liberal arts education’” that attempts to “justify current  educational practices . . . rather than consider changes to the tradition” (162). They  contrast rhetoric as a practical art with the “obstinacy” of continuing to identify  our value with our critique of liberalism and contemporary culture—a stance  which merely “presumes that knowledge of conditions of oppression will lead to  emancipation” (168). Barouch and Ommen’s alternative to such education raises the bar from cri­ tique to actual engagement. Education for engagement would prepare us to face  what Albert Hirschman calls the “successive eruption of problems and crises”  that emerge in society and the “steady diet of conflicts that need to be addressed,”  which society must learn to “manage” (emphasis added, qtd. in Barouch and  Ommen 170). Here, managing is the key.2 Barouch and Ommen envision a “new  mode of liberal art” built on developing rhetorical praxis, with the goal of “ca­ pacity-building as equipment for living within and among limits” (173). Their  students, for instance, would demonstrate the ability not only to recognize the  element of risk in any rhetorical act, but to respond with the socially required  practice of “creation within constraints” (171). Barouch and Ommen’s expectation for a “concrete” response does point out  a limit to the “inventional curriculum” Hartelius proposes, in which invention is  the art of “creativity, discovery, and intellectual production” (173). Engaged rhe­ torical education can indeed offer “equipment for living” in the form of a rhe­ torical praxis that, attuned to conflict, builds the capacity to make wise choices  in the face of uncertainty, risk, and limits (173). However, Barouch and Ommen  also point out that this ideal of “equating invention with intellectual production”  won’t necessarily lead to change or “produce things in the broader world of con­ temporary liberal constraints”—unless we are also able to couple those “abstract  ideas, general knowledge, and theory . . . [with] concrete objectives” (176). A good  example of a “concrete” response would translate an idea or an ethic into a work­ able methodology. For example, Aja Y. Martinez argues that the use of “coun­ terstories” from marginalized speakers hold “the potential for more democratic  representation [that] honors diverse ways of knowing . . . and expanded civic  participation to include historically silenced people” (28). Celebrating the Quarterly Journal of Speech’s one hundredth year of publica­ tion, Robert Asen traces a similar “melioristic turn” in public sphere scholarship  and its growing sense of mission. In moving from the traditional application of  2.	  Their language of “managing conflicts” may seem at odds with Janet Atwill’s view of  rhetoric as what she calls “a transgressive art,” the art that transforms limits and conflicts  into new pathways of possibility. However, what both these have in common is a situated  art of responding to conflict with praxis, with reflection and action. Why Should Assessment Matter?   17   theory (which operates by “abstracting itself from the practices it seeks to un­ derstand”), this mission starts with a reflexive critique of its own methods and  concepts. Moreover, it seeks to use theory not only to read the world but to shape  it, which, it turns out, requires “recognizing the mutually informative relation­ ship of theory and practice” (134). In line with this significant shift in speech  and communication studies, Asen issues a methodological call for fieldwork and  innovative methods that can, for instance, capture “the complexity and variety of  relations between multiple publics” (141). For Nathan Crick, engagements that shape the world involve the process of de­ liberation. Crick builds a rhetorical rationale for this next step, which takes us di­ rectly into the world of community engagement. With John Dewey, he would locate  such rhetorical work in that liminal zone where the conflict between new situations  and the comfort of habitus becomes illuminated by our impulse toward creative  change. Setting this vision in tension with the status quo and its habits can “stimu­ late intelligent deliberation about possible lines of action in the future” (Crick 301).  Rhetorical education can prepare students “by having them consciously encounter  new situations . . . that stimulate the imagination and the will . . . [and] acts of in­ telligence” (302-3). In Crick’s study, set in a rhetorical classroom, these conscious  encounters can lead us into deliberation which, as Dewey envisions it, “concerns  ‘the nature of ordinary judgments upon what it is best or wise to do’ or more pre­ cisely any ‘dramatic rehearsal (in imagination) of various competing possible lines  of action’” (qtd. in Crick 303). This educational ideal of deliberative rehearsal is fur­ ther expanded to include Dewey’s “ethic of communication—that is, an ethic that  necessitates taking the perspective of others into account” (Crick 304). In Dewey,  Martinez, Asen, and Crick, we see an expansive image of learning and that depends  on encounters with others, with conflict, and the need to act. Back in 2016, I was delighted to find that Crick’s essay in Rhetoric Society  Quarterly was placed next to an account of my own effort to put parts of this rhe­ torical pragmatist agenda into practice. Devoted to what I called “difference-driv­ en inquiry,” mine explored a series of community think tanks that organized and  documented cross-cultural, cross-hierarchy problem-solving deliberations on a  shared problem (Flower, “Difference-Driven,” 318). Out of this growing “public  turn” in writing studies, a rich body of research has offered new maps for docu­ menting education for rhetorically based action.3 3.	  For a sense of the varied forms this move to engagement is taking, we might start  with Thomas Miller and Joddy Murray’s excellent introduction to a special issue of College  English: “Reimaging Leadership after the Public Turn.” Nancy Welch’s unflinching analysis  of the prospects for public rhetors in a resistant social climate sets a challenge: if, as her title  asks, “the point is to change it,” what are the links among service outreach, community en­ gagement, and out and out activism? Steve Parks’ fine account (and critique of the limits) of  my own form of community work argues for a switch to social activism with a laser-focus less  on education than on a working-class network mobilizing specific, local, achievable political  change (“Sinners Welcome”). Jeffrey Grabill and Ellen Cushman take inventive collaborative  18   Chapter 1 Unseen Outcomes of Community Engaged Education These lines of argument for engaged rhetorical education would integrate rheto­ ric’s theoretical thinking and its pragmatic art with the challenges that mark con­ temporary culture and the risks, values, and uncertainty our students are facing.  A pragmatic art would not consign the humanities to the limited (and limiting)  paradigm of “course knowledge,” which equates knowledge with what appears in  texts, lectures, discussions, not to mention tests and papers, which can be easily  evaluated. What one learns in rhetoric and composition would not, for instance,  be exclusively identified with topics such as grammar, style, and genre, the history  of rhetoric or its disciplinary concepts. This is not to downplay the value and necessity of this sort of foundational  knowledge at all. And acquiring this sort of knowledge is, of course, one outcome  our institutional apparatus is already well designed to support and measure. On  the other hand, the paradigm of engaged education takes students beyond re­ call, description, analysis, or critique by asking them to create situated knowledge  through purposeful personal and public interaction with others. That is, it allows  them to integrate their academic knowledge with experience in ways that will  instantiate, test, challenge, or adapt what they are learning. This book explores one particular version of this paradigm I will refer to as  community engaged education, defined by its ability to create a dialogue between  academic research and theory and experience, particularly experience with actu­ al others who differ from oneself. Let me elaborate what these terms mean in this  context. The theory, research, and academic arguments we investigate in a course  can include powerful concepts, such as the rhetorical situation, transfer, contact  zone, ideology, as well as theoretical perspectives, from feminism, cultural stud­ ies, or cognitive rhetoric. These are in turn linked to general methods, such as  rhetorical, cultural, discourse, and/or activity analysis, and to the more specific  tools of grounded-theory building, critical incident interviews, process tracing,  or counterstories. When the academic theory one learns moves into engagement  with a community (especially when that community is not one’s own), experience  becomes the educator. That is, engagement with others across difference initiates  a dialogue that can teach the situated meaning(s) of a theory (such as transfer) by  instantiating it in practice. At the same time, that dialogue may also challenge,  reinterpret, or rewrite academic theory and its assumptions as well as generate  new, more adequate understandings. We see this paradigm of engaged education at work in multiple forms of public  digital approaches to “being useful,” while studies by John Ackerman and David Coogan, Ne­ dra Reynolds and Johnathon Mauk take us into the nature of publics. For new research com­ ing out of different engaged agendas, see Ashley Holmes on the practice of public pedagogy,  Elenore Long on the challenging process of “early uptake” in building responsive community  relations, Jennifer Clifton on rhetorically based community/classroom dialogues, and Rachel  Shah (Rewriting) on reciprocal partnerships, and others we will see in our discussion of tools. Why Should Assessment Matter?   19   engagement from community literacy projects and writing centers to partnerships  with schools, community centers, non-profits, tribal councils, and neighborhood  activists. It speaks through multiple discourses, using writing, multimedia, web and  digital tools, in academic and local publications, public forums, and community  publishing. But beyond this evidence of an energetic civic “turn” in academic pub­ lications, its lasting educational value lies in its call to ground students’ intellectual  work in a practice of inquiry and deliberative dialogue beyond their home turf, and  to do so in the service of wise action in the context of wider, diverse relationships.  This kind of hybrid engagement, where research, theory and experiential learn­ ing take to the street together, cannot be limited to merely participating in service,  local projects, or activism. Engaged education calls for a form of praxis built on  an intellectual/experiential dialogue. And its larger end-in-view must be realized  in outcomes which are not necessarily limited to material or political ones, but can  include engaged public, civic, and community understandings built on that dia­ logue. Such understandings become ones a student can act on and take into their  personal and professional life as well. Although our institutional apparatus is not  well designed to track those outcomes beyond the classroom or make our case, new  work on transfer can be one promising place to start. How Does (Does?) an Education for Engagement Transfer? Much of the contemporary discussion of educational outcomes is couched in the  terms of transfer: Is prior knowledge carried over (or not) into new situations?  Yet for all its clear importance, the nature of transfer is cloudy: Its meaning has  undergone substantive re-conceptualizations and shifts in focus; its process and  what triggers it are under debate; and the teaching or training designed to pro­ duce it has had mixed success. The research I have noted below reflects some of  these critical points of disagreement. On the other hand, if we choose to read  these differences as giving us what are inevitably situated accounts (rather than  broadly inclusive definitional ones) we can uncover more useful evidence about  the varied kinds of intellectual work, shaped by the particular tasks, contexts,  and writing our students may face. And, I will argue, reading this research for its  accounts of public consequences can also reveal some outcomes of different forms  of engagement. How Does Transfer Work? Our traditional accounts of academic transfer (when it is not simply an automated  thought triggered by association) involve applying skills you just learned whether  it is to the next assignment or problem set, to a subsequent, more advanced class,  to a related situation, or to an essentially new context in which perhaps only a  few elements overlap. Perkins and Salomon say this process of transfer can motor  down either a low road or a high road. Embarking on the high road typically calls  20   Chapter 1 for metacognition: actively attending to the cues that call up relevant knowledge.  For example, suppose you have just been asked to conduct a cross-cultural inter­ view and write up your interpretation of what transpired—a not uncommon task  students will meet in all kinds of teamwork, counseling, consulting, or customer  service. Of course, there was a discussion of this topic in your course readings,  but in practice . . . . A central problem that troubles the transfer research is not the failure to  dredge up or use prior classroom or school-based knowledge, but even noticing  that it is relevant in a new situation. If the parallels are not explicit, it remains tacit  (Bereiter “Knowledge”). In this cross-cultural encounter, our interviewer must  not only notice the telling interactional cues (about cultural expectations, for in­ stance) that might or might not call up past learning. She must then call on meta­ cognition to apply it (which could also include an awareness of what she doesn’t  know or potentially problematic/inaccurate assumptions). When this takes the  form of explicit declarative knowledge, metaknowledge might include what the  interviewer has (or hasn’t) learned about interview techniques, as well as connec­ tions to past experience, or to the challenge this particular intercultural situation  may present. Metaknowledge, then, allows the interviewer to represent what they  know in ways that lets them think, evaluate, or talk about it—if asked. The term  metacognition, on the other hand, refers to mental action. Although carried out  at varying degrees of awareness, metacognition is the thinking act of calling up  and knowingly applying a repertoire of skills and strategies, from a general skill  of talking across difference, to strategies learned in a class, such as how to frame  a problem or draw out the interviewee’s situated knowledge. Metacognitive work  can be the high-performance engine of transfer. However, we should bear in mind that most studies of transfer in our area  have been conducted on the transfer from first year writing to subsequent cours­ es or from a course in professional writing to an internship. The unit of analysis  is typically either a target task, or the writers themselves (often in terms of their  “disposition” to transfer to not), or the contextual features that shape perfor­ mance. These three foci (on the task, attitude, or context) may offer little insight  into the rhetorical or strategic work of the writer. Compare this, for instance, to  an approach to teaching transfer in which Craig Moreau starts by documenting  the strategies for innovation used in actual workplace teams (“Teams”), trans­ lating those into teachable rhetorical moves and then tracking the (successful)  transfer of these “practices for innovation rhetoric” in professional writing class­ es” (“Teaching” 12).  Moreover, recent research has argued that the notion of “transfer” itself is  problematic, given its image of a static packet of knowledge to be applied rela­ tively intact across tasks, as when the school genre of proposal-writing is neatly  transferred to supposedly parallel tasks in an internship or job (nice work if you  can get it). But in fact, these tasks are more likely to call, first, for the recogni­ tion that what you learned in school actually applies to the new situation (e.g., is  Why Should Assessment Matter?   21   proposing a new collaborative agenda to an inner-city community group likely to  call up the proposal writing assignment you did in college?). In studies of transfer  in technical areas, this recognition often meant discerning the “pragmatic rele­ vance” of your “how-to” knowledge to new problems (Bassok and Holyoak 69).  Second, even with an awareness of the connection, you will likely be forced to  reconstruct what you do know for a typically new, context-bound purpose. In an effort to go beyond the limits of transfer as direct importation of spe­ cific skills or genre features, researchers are proposing new metaphors and ways  of conceptualizing transfer as a more constructive process.4 The expanded act  of transfer they document suggests a useful framework for tracking some of the  outcomes of engaged education. It may demand the prior work of recontextu­ alizing and integrating ideas across disciplines in which transfer is a rhetori­ cal act (Nowacek). Or transfer might involve repurposing knowledge for a new  task (Roozen). Or it may require relearning how to write and the various kinds  of transformation Doug Brent’s student interns had to undertake.5 To cross that  shadowy divide from school into a new multi-tasking, multi-reader rhetorical en­ vironment at work, they had to figure out how to translate their “academic skills  into (workplace) practices” (589). To do so, Brent argued, required a repertoire  of “highly general strategies for managing new tasks” (589) and “more principles  and more conscious awareness of the rhetorical moves [they could] make” (590).  Yet, as Brent points out, student writers were frequently unable to articulate these  kinds of complex adaptive choices or strategies. The absence of articulation ap­ parently makes a difference. When asked to revise a troubled publicity document,  his inexperienced writers depended on the swift, automated slide into rewriting.  The experienced writers, on the other hand, displayed the additional ability to  recognize, often name, and reflect on choices and alternatives. Of course, the act  of diagnosis is a cognitively expensive option. And in our process tracing studies  of experts and novices revising, the experienced writers did not always turn to  diagnosis. It was, however, what we soon dubbed as “the expert’s option”: a re­ flection of the writer’s capacity for strategic choice when it was needed (Flower  et al., “Detection” 47). And when writers must become, in Rebecca Nowacek’s  metaphor, “agents of integration,” reshaping, repurposing, or resituating their  knowledge, strategic choice becomes their ace in the hole. In the atmosphere of challenge and uncertainty that often surrounds transfer,  4.	  The following studies offer helpful reviews of this literature, showing some of the  different ways in which such transformations can be parsed: Elizabeth Wardle on repur­ posing (“Creative”); Doug Brent on transformative learning for internships; Anne Beau­ fort on mental schemas and heuristics (College Writing); Ryan Roderick on self-regula­ tion; Kathleen Yancy on reflective meaning making (Introduction). 5.	  Useful parallels to this contrast in kinds of knowing appear in the work of develop­ mental psychologists Scardamalia and Bereiter, who show how young writers must learn  to move from what they call knowledge-telling to knowledge-transformation that takes a  larger set of constraints into account (such as a reader’s expectations). 22   Chapter 1 it is hardly surprising that a transformative effort will also involve a disposition or  willingness to engage its demands (Roderick). Such a disposition is affected, as Neil  Baird and Bradley Dilger show, not only by the student’s expected return on the  effort, but also by their sense of ownership and self-efficacy, as well as the easiness  with which they face complexity or difficulty (706). Moreover, the past “knowledge”  we call up is typically embedded in personal experience, often saturated with its  associated affective elements, ranging from curiosity, ah ha moments, or confidence,  to uncertainty, incompetence, or anxiety (Efklides). So to assess any act of transfer  as a significant educational outcome, we must first consider the first consider the  contextual, cognitive, and affective demands the individual had to deal with. Challenging the Assumptions of “Transfer” Itself At this point, our image of socially significant outcomes gets raised a notch as  we begin to see how engaged classes that link academic theory with experience  may support a kind of transfer that can reach across tasks, contexts, and time.  King Beach enters this debate by significantly expanding the whole unit of anal­ ysis beyond the individual and/or the task, redefining transfer as a sociocultural  interaction between people and their contexts (an interaction which can, in fact,  change those relations). As in the case of cross-cultural interviews or a commu­ nity/university collaboration, writers, whatever their prior knowledge, are being  plunged into a network of dynamic, often contradictory forces. In such situa­ tions, transfer, as Beach reconceptualizes it, becomes a “consequential transition  among social activities” (104). In practice, a transition means stepping beyond  mere application of familiar practices into “the construction of new knowledge,  identities, ways of knowing and new positionings of oneself in the world” (113).  These transitions can become consequential, as he uses the term, “when they are  consciously reflected on, often struggled with, and the eventual outcome changes  one’s sense of self and social positioning” (113-14). That is, when the consequence  of this reconstruction is the alteration of actual interactions. To get at another aspect of this complex dynamic, Elizabeth Wardle uses the  concept of creative repurposing, in which students make the strategic choice to take  a “problem-exploring” versus an “answer-getting” approach to new, ill-structured  problems (1-2). In the problem-solving stance she observes, students question not  only their own habits of mind, but assumptions derived from prior schooling.  Like Beach, her theorizing is based on an expanded cognitive and socio-cultural  image of learning developed in activity theory (a lens to which we will also turn). For instance, these “consequential” situations (i.e., ones that demand creative or  reconstructive thinking) often involve a shift from one setting or activity system to  another, such as from school to work.6 Or perhaps your situation is itself is in flux,  6.	  A recent fascinating review of transfer focused on teaching for “information liter- acy” shows us why community literacy earns a blue ribbon for transfer. Conducting their  Why Should Assessment Matter?   23   responding to new circumstances or to the impact of your own presence, strategies,  ideas. (e.g., in the midst of conducting that cross-cultural interview, something ap­ pears to have triggered a new but hidden agenda for your interlocutor. Or halfway  through a series of interviews on a community issue, you realize the focus of your  own inquiry or perhaps the social/political climate for this cultural exchange has  shifted.) You can no longer respond by merely “applying past knowledge” or genre  cues but must actually figure out how best to engage in this shape-shifting, socially  embedded literate practice on the spot, in the act of performing it. Another force that generates a powerful stimulus to transfer—one that a com­ munity-engaged experience is uniquely designed to deliver—is an emotional in­ vestment in the writing. Exploring the experience of writers, Jonathan Alexander  et al. draw a distinction between “affect” as merely a felt condition and “emo­ tion” as “a type of feeling writers consciously ascribe to their composing process  and writing lives” (566). Tracking what they call the “wayfinding” of post-col­ lege writers (that is, writers adapting and learning in the face of new, unexpected  situations) they stress the impact emotion, disposition, and metacognition have  on “long-term learning development and writing transfer” (569). One of the key  impacts on transfer was “meaningful writing,”—experiencing “the potentiality of  writing,” the “opportunity to mobilize [it] for real-world interventions” and the  emotional investment often linked to the process of inquiry and discovery (583). What these studies highlight is not simply a difference in how one names the  process of transfer, but the highly variable, distinctly situated acts these different  researchers are tracking. So in the context of public engagement, it makes sense  to look for the kind of high-road, highwire constructive work that might support  a transformative transfer. The irony of transfer research is that most of these studies, whatever aspect  of the process they examine, tend to document that transfer fails as often as it  succeeds (Wardle; Moore; Beaufort, “Reflection”). Even experienced writers  have trouble with this portage, leading Chris Anson to argue that neither pri­ or knowledge, a repertoire of general rhetorical strategies, nor meta-knowledge  about the problem can replace evolving, experience-based learning. In fact, Ryan  Roderick proposes that we should shift our attention away from the transfer of  genre knowledge and its conventions and onto the student’s adaptive capacity  for “self-regulated learning,” that is, “a writer’s practices of recognizing, evaluat­ ing, and reacting to emerging accomplishments or problems” (414). In the face  research across disciplines and contexts, this study first identifies four “themes that en- hance learning”: Preparation for Learning, Active Learning, Metacognition & Reflection,  and Social Learning. Three of the four are hallmarks of community engaged education. In  the following more detailed of review of sixteen areas of scholarship within each theme— eleven of the sixteen normally turn up in community-engaged projects (e.g., promote  perspective taking; problem-based learning strategies, seeking out other’s opinions) (Kug- litsch and Roberts, 22-23). 24   Chapter 1 of new tasks, writers who reflect on their own performances can identify con­ flicts or difficulties, which may lead to significant changes in their goals, strate­ gies, and motivations. They make it “consequential.” In his comparative analysis  of self-regulation, Roderick tracked writers’ responses to problems or conflicts  which triggered one of these moments of generative reflection. Although all these  graduate students were writing center mentors who had received the same train­ ing, they handled their problems in strikingly different ways and with varying  levels of adaptive success. Focusing on the successful mentors, he discovered the  self-regulating strategies that made the difference entailed a reflective use of the  problems themselves. These self-regulators spent thinking time framing the con­ flict, setting goals, and even envisioning a narrative of progress. In a second, fine- grained study of a student’s transition from an MA to a PhD program in rhetoric,  Roderick and Moreau saw how self-regulation not only helped the student devel­ op genre knowledge, but construct a new scholarly identity (158). Cognitive rhetoric offers insight into another transformative practice rooted in  the fact that writers must construct (and frequently reconstruct) for themselves an  understanding of what an assignment means or a situation demands. The internal  “task representation” which experienced writers give themselves is not simply more  rhetorically complex than those of novices, it is also likely to recognize conflicting  readings of the situation and priorities they must deal with as well as appropriate  practices. In effect, expert and novice writers often end up working on striking­ ly different self-constructed “assignments” (Flower, Construction 77). In technical  domains, this adaptive, problem-framing expertise also shows up in the quality of  one’s knowledge representation, which includes seeing the rationales behind ac­ tions (Gott et al. 259). Knowing “how to” goes beyond possessing a standard pro­ cedure; it depends on a strategic representation of how things function, one which  tells you when to use knowledge and why (267). Once again, the issue is not simply  whether one uses prior knowledge, but when and how. Research in psychology, seeking more expanded accounts of learning, can  also help us articulate what an engaged education needs to deliver. The studies  collected in Douglas Detterman and Robert Sternberg’s aptly named Transfer on  Trial acknowledge that the recall of course concepts/methods and the ability to  apply them in a final paper or subsequent course is indeed a useful skill. How­ ever, the notion that what we transfer is a symbolic representation or packet of  “knowledge” is thoroughly dismantled as an adequate indicator of learning. In an  extensive review of educational research, James Greeno, Joyce Moore, and David  Smith argue that because traditional approaches to transfer treat prior knowledge  as a propositional or symbolic structure abstracted from context, these concep­ tualizations lack the explanatory power that activity-based theory and the data  on situated cognition can offer. Moreover, this activity-based way of conceptu­ alizing knowledge opens a new path for tracking the dynamics that create situ­ ated knowledge. Knowledge, they say, would be better understood as “knowing”  rather than an invariant, stable property one possesses. Knowing “is relative to  Why Should Assessment Matter?   25   situations, an ability to interact with things and other people in various ways . .  . In the view of situated cognition, we need to characterize knowing, reasoning,  understanding and so on as relations between cognitive agents and situations  . . . and learning is improvement in that ability” (99-100). So what successful learners take away from their classes is not merely the  theories, claims, or procedures we teach but models of agents and objects in inter­ action, knitted together with real-world knowledge, prior experience, and infer­ ences. To transfer that dynamic knowing means recognizing the key parallels in a  new situation, used as cues to construct an adapted, parallel model for how to in­ teract in this new situation (Greeno et al. 145-55). From this perspective, it makes  little sense to speak of the transfer of a knowledge object (such as a genre, theory,  or practice) when the work in question is the adaptation of knowing acquired in  school to a new situation in which success is gauged by interacting within a wider  social and cognitive activity. The argument here is that one distinctive outcome of a liberal arts education  can be this style of “interactive knowing,” which can support Beach’s self-con­ scious, “consequential” transitions that reshape knowledge, relationships, and  identity. It endows learners with Barouch and Ommen’s equipment for living, such  as Roderick’s strategies for self-regulation in the face of problems (and how to  represent them), or that hard-to-objectify knowing that guides interaction within  a social, cognitive, and cultural activity system. An obvious inference from these  accounts of transfer in action is that bringing classroom learning into the test bed  of a shape-shifting, real world engagement, and reflecting on the feedback it can  give is the high road to transfer. Community engagement offers the ideal place to  develop this knowing. Nevertheless, to build a persuasive case for an engaged ed­ ucation, grounded in the interactive nature of learning, means that we will prob­ ably need new ways to recognize its presence in everyday life.7˛ An Expanded Image of Learning Studies that work from an expanded image of learning itself frequently draw on  activity theory—the legacy of Lev Vygotsky and the influential analytical para­ digm of Yrjö Engeström that has stimulated research in psychology, sociology,  management, education, and rhetoric. Locating learning and its uses within a  more complex cognitive, social, cultural activity system lets us see how our dis­ position, generative problem-solving strategies, reflection, and metacognitive  7.	  For example, a typical study hoped to prove the impact of a new curriculum fo- cused on global issues and empathy. Its measurement tool, a university-wide outcome  assessment based on writing, showed no growth. However, researchers doing a thematic  reading of these students’ writing, were struck by another kind of knowing—the frequen- cy of students’ reflection “on their personal experiences” (Branson et. al. 302) Maybe, they  suggest, “we had picked the wrong focus for the available . . . outcomes” (302). 26   Chapter 1 awareness might interact with socially and culturally supplied tools, rules, and  contexts. Doing so remaps the territory of outcomes, opening paths for assessing  the dynamically interactive knowing engagement can create. As we will see in the case studies and chapters that follow, activity analysis ex­ pands the unit of analysis in three dimensions. This lens directs our attention first  to an agent acting on an object (e.g., a goal, task, or centering object and its atten­ dant outcomes), which is in turn embedded in a community. Secondly, it calls us  to locate these three elements (agent, objects, and community) within a larger ac­ tivity system, which includes rules, roles (a division of labor including power and  status), and mediating tools (both material and conceptual). Finally, and perhaps  most importantly, this image of activity is characterized not only by the constant  interaction among these elements but by contradictions or competing agendas  between them. Attending to these contradictions turns out to be critical because  they are most often the sites where innovation or change happens (Engeström  “Developmental Studies”). In fact, as Engeström shows, it is when people attend  to the challenges and contradictions within an activity system that they are most  likely achieve what he calls “expansive learning,” which embraces conflict. Unlike  that image of transfer in which one inserts a packet of prior knowledge into the  appropriate slot of a new task, in activity theory, prior knowledge is much more  likely to walk into, as William James puts it, “the blooming, buzzing confusion” of  an activity, where contradiction is not only likely, but a force that drives creative  change (488). This expanded unit of analysis grows out of Engeström’s combined concern  with social justice and highly situated research into the interactions of people  at work. His influential framework for analyzing activity systems helps us see  rhetorical action embedded, whether we realize it or not, in a network of social,  cognitive, cultural, and material forces. It gives us a language for describing how  those forces interact in organizations and intercultural or community contexts.  And its call to uncover contradictions makes community voices and marginal­ ized interpretations suddenly quite essential. In response to the questions, insights, and arguments sketched above, this  study hopes to reach beyond the limited world and measuring sticks of the  classroom to add new pieces to the puzzle of education for engagement and the  problem of articulating some of its outcomes. It starts with a reconceptualiza­ tion of transfer—into an action located in the dynamic interaction between pri­ or knowledge and new tasks, contexts, purposes, and people. This dynamic, in  turn, supports a hypothesis about the distinctive potential of engaged education.  By embedding the integration of academic and experiential knowledge within  meaningful public action, we can uniquely prepare students for taking informed,  critical personal agency within interpersonal collaboration in a world of complex,  value-laden social interactions. The framework of activity theory can also help extend this educational hy­ pothesis by including a more elaborated, cognitive account of how writers both  Why Should Assessment Matter?   27   interpret the activity of learning (including its rules, roles, and tools) and respond  with strategic choices. Secondly, in moving beyond the classroom to locate out­ comes emerging from these more complex activities of collaborative and com­ munity engagement, our unit of analysis will shift from the tasks, genre knowl­ edge, or other bodies of information associated with transfer to asking what kind  of “knowing” was constructed by a given student and to what effect? That is, what  does such education allow people to do in both thought and act? Finally, I will  argue for conceptualizing our query at times in terms of not only transfer but in  some impressive acts of constructive transformation as we will see students create  new ideas and actions out of their learning. The chapters which follow will build a case for the distinctive contribution a  community-engaged education can make within this expanded image of learn­ ing and knowing. Doing so will call for new methods of tracking these broader,  socially significant outcomes of learning. So, the case studies of each chapter will  also explore a set of informal research methods for documenting what students  are making out of an engaged course. Finally, my argument will include research  that takes us beyond transfer to what we can describe as transformations by track­ ing what that combination of academic knowledge, experience, and collaborating  across difference lets students create and do—sometimes years after the course.  Drawing on these cases, we will conclude with an inquiry into what it could mean  to teach for transformation. Chapters 2 and 3 will explore a series of cases that show engaged students in  action. These student participants built life tools and new understandings, raised  questions, and altered institutional practices, supported by the metacognitive in­ sight to name the change they saw. The cases will demonstrate ways of using the  critical incident lens and interviews, comparative coding for frequency, as well as  activity analysis, and data-based self-reflection. Chapter 4 tracks students within an engaged class developing both metacog­ nitive awareness of their own problematic interpretive frames and working the­ ories for ways to change them. It will demonstrate tracking circulation and con­ flict, grounded-practical-theory building, frame analysis, pre/post comparisons  using comparative statistics and visuals, methods of circulating students’ results,  and situated, re-interpretation by the students. Chapter 5 will document outcomes in which students are transforming their  learning into remarkably diverse personal and public actions. Using critical in­ cident interviews carried out up to ten years after a course-based engaged expe­ rience, along with coding for leadership, and a comparison of their key insights  with research, it will reveal a rich self-analysis of applied learning Chapter 6 uses the frameworks of activity theory and grounded-theory build­ ing to explore two approaches to teaching not just for transfer but for transfor­ mation. It demonstrates how those frameworks can be used for analyzing one’s  rhetorical situation and collaboration, building a grounded theory, testing for  metacognitive awareness, and teaching students to use those tools for themselves. 29 Chapter 2. Creating Personal Outcomes If writing is indeed a public as well as a personal rhetorical act, one might won­ der, what are the indicators of valued outcomes? The work on service-learning,  however, shows how little attention we typically pay to public outcomes. In fact,  as Paula Mathieu charges, institutional goals for constantly increasing student  placement numbers lead universities to ignore (if not dismiss) community needs  when they initiate and evaluate service-learning (Flower and Heath; Shah). For some like Aaron Schutz and Ann Gere, these reports are an indictment  of service-learning for its failure to raise students’ cultural awareness and chal­ lenge their desire merely to help. And as Richard Bradley reminds us, “What gets  measured gets done . . . If you can’t see success, you can’t reward it . . . If you can’t  recognize failure, you can’t learn from it” (151). Not unlike the holistic claims and  the search for a broad array of effects seen in the research on career education  in the 1970s, on experiential education in the 1980s, and on service-learning in  1990s, the enduring finding seems to be that the specific things you teach, sup­ port, monitor, and measure are the ones students learn. The ability to demonstrate public outcomes is especially important for pro­ grams tied to community development in which students can play a real role  in public issues (Miller 107). And the non-profit community organizations with  which we often work are regularly required to justify their funding from founda­ tions in terms of outcomes. Yet as Teresa Redd’s study of assessment in service  learning showed, there can be “significant discrepancies in the teacher and client  assessment stemming from different views of the rhetorical situation” (15). When  we don’t work to articulate the indicators we are working toward, teachers, part­ ners and clients can disagree on what constitutes an effective public performance.  So the next two chapters will use four case studies to explore four distinctive  kinds of outcomes: 1.	 Building Everyday Life Tools 2.	 Constructing New Understandings and Open Questions 3.	 Altering Institutional Practice 4.	 Naming the Change You Want to See Each case will move from a brief description of the activity system to a more  detailed discussion of different conceptual and methodological tools educators  can use to track outcomes, followed by a final discussion of what my collaborators  and I in fact observed using these tools. Case 1: Building Everyday Life Tools In a review of the research on service-learning, Robert Serow concludes, “The lit­ erature on program impact in particular seems to consist disproportionately of  30   Chapter 2 studies grounded in a single approach—namely, the statistical analysis of responses  to surveys of short-term attitude change” (13). Moreover, the participants in these  activities may hold contradictory goals. Faculty may be working toward goals of  political empowerment framed as a “movement toward certain highly egalitarian  political and economic objectives” (17). However, the students in Serow’s exten­ sive interviews appear more concerned with gaining personal empowerment and  feelings of self-efficacy from helping (17). Serow sums up his broad overview of  research and evaluation on service-learning by naming four desired outcomes. In  addition to the traditional academic goals of “competence” and “understanding,”  students see service in terms of “participation” and “relationships,” which they con­ sider ends in themselves. And in qualitative and quantitative studies alike, the value  of service-oriented community experience is typically measured by its ability to  produce student reported gains in self-understanding, self-confidence, self-esteem,  and, to a lesser extent, self-efficacy. These are desirable. However, little is said about  the ability of service-learning to support democratic or deliberative action, trans­ formed understanding, or social impact. In our first case, the exigence motivating  assessment at Pittsburgh’s Community Literacy Center was an upcoming founda­ tion impact report and proposal for renewed funding.1 The Case The Community Literacy Center as sketched in the Introduction was a communi­ ty/university collaboration inviting teenagers in its urban neighborhood to write  newsletters and hold public Community Conversations about issues that shaped  their lives—issues ranging from risk and respect to pathways to work, school sus­ pension policies, handling police encounters, or teen stress. It also brought Car­ negie Mellon students into an intercultural relationship with the teenagers—not  as tutors but as mentors to support teenagers writing from the expertise of their  own experience. However, in 1990, when we coined the term “community literacy” for our  effort, philanthropic foundations equated the term “literacy” with the low-level,  low-impact programs of adult literacy. And writing seemed less significant (read:  less fundable) than typical projects related to teenage social behavior and school  retention. So our five-year follow-up study had to justify this rhetorically based  engagement, essentially reframing a standard assessment and its methods. And  we wanted to do it in terms of outcomes for the teenagers themselves. Using a Critical Incident Lens This critical incident method of assessment was not the norm for service pro­ grams as Serow had described them. Although this case illustrates a rather simple  1.	  The Community Literacy Center and this report are described in more detail in  Flower’s Community Literacy and the Rhetoric of Public Engagement. Creating Personal Outcomes  31 empirical method, what it attempts to capture is whether this educational, writ­ ing-based experience was still playing a role in the teenagers’ lives a year after be­ ing in a six-week Community Literacy Center project. What, if anything, of their  experience with literate empowerment would transfer to the markedly different  activity systems of urban life and schools? The impact report, titled “Where Have  We Come? What Have We Learned?”, began by responding to the standard cate­ gories by which institutions measure effectiveness: school retention and grades,  social behavior of youth (delinquency, pregnancy), jobs, and program participa­ tion (Flaxman and Orr). For instance, it included figures on the unusually high level of school en­ gagement by students who had participated with the CLC (88% attendance),  supported by an assessment questionnaire in which seventy percent of what  would be called “at-risk” students actually gave the educational activities at the  CLC their highest ranking, a 5 on our scale of 1 to 5. These results were followed  by empirical evidence of the program’s public engagement and circulation, in­ cluding its publications, contacts with local government and school adminis­ tration, and especially one of the teen-led Community Conversations which  (because the mayor attended) reached a TV news broadcast audience of nearly  4,000 Pittsburghers. Music to a funder’s ears no doubt. But what about the  teenagers themselves? So our report tried to capture the teenagers’ progress by tracking down 14  students who had participated in a CLC project a year prior to ask the question  educational institutions rarely ask: Does this learning transfer to your life? To  answer this question, we turned to structured critical incident interviews, de­ signed to uncover more concrete accounts for something that really happened  in place of an abstraction, generality, retrospective interpretation, or what the  respondent thinks the researcher wants to hear (Flanagan). These interviews  were conducted by Mrs. Baskins, the engaging African American co-director  the students trusted, who initiated the interview by merely asking if they re­ called any of the key problem-solving strategies we had taught through writ­ ing (e.g., strategies for analyzing problems, considering rival hypotheses (or  rivaling), decision-making, collaboration, and community engagement). They  then moved to the central open-ended critical incident interview question: Can  you describe any specific instances—actual events—in which you used what you  learned at the CLC? The catch was, for their response to make it into the analysis, “yes” wasn’t  enough. The “critical incident” research method prompts people to bear down on  a particular event or actual interaction with questions such as, “What happened  next?” “What were you thinking?” “What did other people say?” We then count­ ed as evidence only those comments that cited specific instances and examples  describing how the teens had indeed used their CLC experience. The coded re­ sults indicated, somewhat to our surprise, that a year later, eighty percent of the  teens (on average) were able to cite one or more codable instances of a specific  32   Chapter 2 literate strategy transferring to their lives, distributed across a variety of contexts,  even their life plans.2 Table 2.1 Number of Teenagers Describing the  Transfer of a Specific Literate Strategy In School At Home In Society On Life Plans  CLC’s Transfer Index 13 = 93% 12 = 86% 11 = 79% 9 = 64% 80% What We Observed Excerpts from the recorded comments themselves, including those noted here,  suggest the nature of this “transfer” and the extent to which the teens choose to  use these literate practices, transforming them into ways to respond differently to  the world around them—ranging from parents, teachers, and friends to the pres­ sures of urban stress and even violence. For example, students Daryl and Jason  talked about using the strategies to navigate difficult situations with family and  at school: [On the Rivaling strategy]: “Before, when I had nowhere to go  [for help], I couldn’t say nothin’ because nobody would listen.  Before I wouldn’t rival nobody; I thought it in my head, but  couldn’t talk.”—Daryl [On the Story-Behind-the-Story strategy]: “When my brother  & I didn’t have a place to live and nobody would take us, I tried  to understand their side—my aunt didn’t have money; my dad  had no room.”—Daryl [On the Options and Outcomes Decision-Making strategy]: “Af­ ter moving to a new neighborhood where white guys at school  were overheard saying, “Niggers gonna come up here and take  over,” I could fight and get suspended, but I stop and think, if I  don’t, they might get caught and I go on. My friend always be  fighting white kids. I tell him “just chill, be cool.”—Jason Although the impact report included the usual sorts of data collected on these  teens, perhaps the most valuable aspect of tracking this sort of transformation is  the way it shifts the locus of agency away from the program to the young people.  It translates the conventional indicators of success (in which empowerment is  2.	  The bottom row of the table shows the number of students reporting a critical inci­ dent in which they used that strategy. Although we initially asked the participants briefly  to recall any strategies they learned merely to prompt their memories, the coding was  based on the conceptual cues rather than explicitly using any name we gave the strategy.  The name of a strategy in italics was added for clarity, not mentioned at the time. Creating Personal Outcomes  33 equated with behavioral norms) into acts of personal decision-making, reflective  understanding, and rhetorical action. Compared to the metaphor of transferring  (what we taught), the outcomes the teenagers report are better described as the  kind of constructive cognitive acts we see in writers as they build new, “negotiat­ ed meanings” (Flower, Construction). In sum, critical incident interviews can serve a number of purposes (Flanagan).  First, as an assessment tool, they can focus on the students’ own assessments of  both the program’s usefulness and the value of the distinctive experience the proj­ ect offered (in this case, using writing to try out new problem-solving strategies).  The interviews document a critical outcome: giving students new thinking tools  and agency that they could actually put to use in choices that mattered. As a result,  the report itself worked as an argument to funders advocating the lasting impacts  of community-focused literacy. Finally, we discovered that as these teenagers were  engaging in the interview itself, they appeared to be achieving a new level of meta­ cognitive understanding of their own options. Tracking achievement can do more  than justify our own practices. As a reflective, pedagogical moment, the interviews  helped these students see and articulate their own agency as both learners and so­ cial actors—to an appreciative listener. In short, the interviews documented that  these students were indeed building everyday life tools that mattered. Case 2. Constructing New Understanding  and Open Questions Much of what we learned at the Community Literacy Center transferred to a  variety of educational practices designed to shape academic engagement for col­ lege students as well as teenagers. One of these outcomes was a course in which  an extended difference-driven public dialogue was used to translate theoretical  concepts and rhetorical issues into actions. The Case The setting for this case study is the Leadership, Dialogue, and Change course in  which a key theory studied by graduate and undergraduate students was Ronald  Heifetz’s model of “adaptive leadership” developed at Harvard’s Kennedy School  of Government. In this paradigm, leaders are defined not by a charismatic appeal  that creates “followers” but by the ability to draw a community into facing its  tough “adaptive” challenges: the ones that may call for learning, re-evaluation,  and even a change in practice. Heifetz’s work (which we studied in comparison  with other models of social change, such as John Dewey and American Prag­ matism, as well as the works of Martin Luther King, Jr., Cornel West, and Saul  Alinsky) invited students to examine their own experience and their assumptions  about what makes good leadership. Then they began to test theory against prac­ tice by organizing a Community Think Tank. 34   Chapter 2 To gain insight into the students’ personal takeaways, let me first sketch what  the class was doing. To develop this particular Community Think Tank, the class  took up the problems facing a little-recognized group on campus, first generation  and/or working students as they navigated the culture and demands of a high-pres­ sure, high price tag university. We choose to identify these people as “Independent  students” to recognize both their situation and agency in the absence of support.  In order to document these problems from multiple campus perspectives, the class  conducted a series of “critical incident interviews” (Flanagan) to create a Briefing  Book designed for participants based directly on the interviews and their research.  (See Figure 2.1) They then used it to guide the subsequent set of roundtable prob­ lem-solving sessions with a cross-campus body of stakeholders. Drawing on some of  the rhetorical strategies developed at the CLC, these Think Tanks used the Briefing  Book as a prompt to help participants explore clearly different (sometimes outright  conflicting) perspectives—giving special presence to the marginalized voices of In­ dependent students in the Briefing Book and at the table. Over the course of sever­ al roundtables—in which administrators, counselors, and faculty worked face-to- face with a cross-section of students—the participants responded to and expanded  competing representations of “the problem” as documented in the Briefing Book. As  the group moved to proposing concrete Options for tackling these problems, they  were asked to test their ideas by imagining possible alternative Outcomes. Having  organized, moderated, and documented their Community Think Tank, the students  then distributed and published their “Findings” on the Think Tank website.3 The outline in Figure 2.1 (from a related Think Tank) shows the structure  of a Briefing Book sent to participants of a given Think Tank. Here my brief ex­ planatory comments are added in [italics]. Its questions and quotations served as  prompts for the discussion. It is included as a way to suggest the variety of literate  acts this experience calls out. The course gives us an example of socially engaged learning with a particularly  strong emphasis on integrating theory, student research, and face-to-face collab­ oration across various kinds of differences. So, what was learned? In the present  case, our insight into the sort of understanding individual students were devel­ oping is based on an end-of-the-semester, four-page written assignment discuss­ ing how they had applied what they had learned (i.e., taught themselves). These  probing reflections reveal an adaptive, personally relevant constructive process in  which it is easy to see how their learning was not limited to propositional knowl­ edge or procedures, much less to simple transfer. In terms of David Greeno’s et al.  studies of situated cognition, these reflections turned out to describe an impact  on students’ “ability to interact with things and other people in a situation.” The  challenge is finding a way to display how Greeno’s relational “knowing” (which  will be different for every student) shows up in actual social experience (100). 3.

The structure of a Briefing Book.  36   Chapter 2  Using Activity Analysis and Its Social, Cultural, and Cognitive Lens Using Yrjö Engeström’s influential model of an activity system offers a valuable  roadmap for exploring socially embedded action. Focused on the critical forces at  work within a particular social, cultural, historical, and cognitive system, activity  analysis can reveal how these forces are interacting, shaping, and reshaping the  activity itself. Researchers have studied activity systems within many contexts: for  example, a classroom with genre expectations (Russell), a professional internship  (Brent), a middle school trying to redesign its practice (Sannino), a traffic court  (Engeström, “Tensions”), and a healthcare clinic wanting to improve coordina­ tion (Engeström, “Developmental”). Analysis works from the perspective of an agent or Subject within a given  Community who is facing what activity theorists call an Object (i.e., a task, a set  of goals, or a problem space), plus its Outcome(s). Having identified our Object,  including our goals and their outcomes, an activity analysis asks us to examine  the influence of three other critical forces within this particular system: its “Rules”  (such as institutional traditions); its “Division of Labor” (which might be collab­ orative or dictated by hierarchy, status, or power); and finally, the less obvious  force of what Lev Vygotsky called “Mediational Means” (Wertsch). Mediational  means range from material tools (e.g., a pen vs. a typewriter vs. a computer for  composition) to intellectual tools (e.g., concepts and practices). For this analysis,  I refer to these three shaping forces as “Rules, Roles, and Tools.” In Figure 2.2, Engeström’s elaborated model of an activity system works as a  heuristic to identify some of the forces at work in a particular activity—in this  case, his own action of preparing a speech for an international congress on ac­ tivity theory (ISCRAT) (“Activity” 31). Here the straight lines merely indicate an  interaction between parts of the system. However, the jagged lines indicate two  “Contradictions” within the activity. The first exists between “the very challeng­ ing issues activity theory is facing and the rather weak instruments of collabora­ tion and discussion at our disposal” (32). In the second, disciplinary silos (formed  in the Division of Labor) come into a conflicted interaction with the group’s at­ tempt to collaborate on key issues or build new tools (sought in the outcome).  It is important to note that when Contradictions arise in the activity system, the  elements in conflict, like those of disciplinary cohorts, are likely to also be serving  a useful purpose for someone somewhere in the system. In fact, the real payoff in analyzing an activity system comes in uncovering  both those Contradictions within the activity and how people deal with them.  For instance, students may face a Contradiction in an encounter with faculty or  university administrators, as when students’ impulse to use a Tool (such as the  energetic, generative practice of offering rivals and counter stories of personal ex­ perience during class) comes in conflict with certain social Rules (such as certain  norms of deference or the attribution of expert knowledge to a professor in this  hierarchical connection). A desire to avoid Contradictions may also explain why  Creating Personal Outcomes  37 groups will turn a serious problem-posing deliberation into a mere “committee  meeting” to avoid violating a Rule or convention of collegiality. For some students  in the Leadership, Dialogue, and Change class, my request for a written reflection  on ways they had put their experience to personal “use” contradicted their un­ derstanding of a graded “assignment” as a display of course knowledge, a course  evaluation, or a summary of “what they liked” about the course. In contrast, from  my point of view, assigning this reflective Tool was designed to help them articu­ late their learning as a path to metaknowledge and to give me insight as a teacher  into the sort of knowledge they were constructing out of this experience. When the Object of an activity is the creation of new knowledge, activity the­ ory and American pragmatism locate the significance of that knowledge in its  consequences. A written demonstration of what we have learned is, of course, a  standard educational tool to both create and measure understanding. But in an  engaged education, it is even more important to see new knowledge as itself a  mediational tool which is evaluated not by its abstract rational structure or truth  to nature but by its consequences for human activity. The value of knowledge is its  transformational power (Engeström, “Innovative” 385). Moreover, as we will see  in Chapter 3, the usefulness of Greeno’s interactive knowing may not be obvious  in advance (as when one is facing a final exam). But it may be mobilized (in the  face of unanticipated exigency) as a mediational tool with a material effect. Can  we demonstrate that powerful outcome? Figure 2.2. Engeström’s elaborated model of an activity system.

Reproduced with permission of The Licensor through PLSclear. 38   Chapter 2 Consider our desire to issue a call for change, given our country’s intercultur­ al context, with its deep-rooted cultural conflicts and history of social injustice.  Although we may possess a new understanding, presenting that knowledge as a  theory or critique that claims it is a new Truth is unlikely to be a change maker.  Genuinely transformational knowledge causes a change in the way people, their  Tools, and their worlds interact—a change in everyday practice itself. A challenging set of criteria for building transformational knowledge in ev­ eryday settings is emerging from Engeström’s studies of courtrooms, medical  clinics, and work teams. The process he describes begins with “individual subjects  questioning the accepted practice” (“Innovative” 383) and ends when an “initial  simple idea is transformed into a complex object, a new form of practice” (382).  People do not achieve consensus, he argues, through the force of a general argu­ ment, but when the germ of an idea ascends, in an ironic turn of phrase, “from the  abstract to the concrete” and emerges as a coherent, workable action (382, 401).  In a remarkable statement, he concludes that the outcome of knowledge building  is the “creation of artifacts, production of novel social patterns, and expansive  transformation of activity contexts” (“Activity” 27). These transformations are “expansive” because they draw people with rival  perspectives into communication that lets them reconceptualize the ways they  are organized and interacting around a shared concern (Engeström, “Innovative”  373). Within this multi-vocal event, transformation produces “a re-orchestration  of those voices, of the different viewpoints and approaches of the various partic­ ipants” (“Activity” 35). The significant strength of the lens of activity analysis, I  would argue, lies in this richly specified set of potential outcomes. The implications of these criteria for change become even clearer when Enge­ ström applies them, as we saw, to a familiar activity—the theory-building activity  of researchers. The acid test of a theory according to activity analysis is its creative  productivity—its “practical validity and relevance in interventions that aim at the  construction of new models of activity” (“Activity” 35). But this is successful re­ search with an added twist. Those novel social artifacts and forms of practice this  activity produces are most significant first when they are created “jointly with the  local participants” (35). And secondly, when those creations support the “possi­ bility of human agency and transformation of social structures from below” (29). The activity lens can also reveal how a Tool, such as the CLC’s rival hypoth­ esis stance, can also be transformed when it moves from one activity system to  another. This conceptual Tool emerged from a National Science Foundation re­ search project on “literacy in science” in which we asked how the notion of “rival  hypothesis thinking” was understood and taught in different disciplines, from  philosophy and rhetoric to social and hard sciences (Flower et al. Learning to  Rival). The initial case studies conducted on this question revealed that while fac­ ulty in biology and history described how rival hypothesis thinking was central  to their own theory and research, it was modeled only indirectly in their lectures,  and their TAs never taught or mentioned it—though one said she used it as a  Creating Personal Outcomes  39 benchmark to identify the “A” papers! So we designed a follow-up study with a  group of (mostly under-prepared) entering college students to track the effect of  directly teaching this interdisciplinary power tool. And it indeed produced some  dramatic changes in the sophistication of arguments on a controversial topic and  the ways in which they structured their writing (Flower et al. Learning to Rival). At the university, this rival hypothesis move served primarily as a genre guide  to critical essay writing. When we took it to the CLC, however, it was transformed  into an important tool for collaborative planning, which let the mentors draw the  teenage writers into rhetorical reflection by asking, “But what if someone else  (e.g., your grandma, a gang member) said . . . ?” More significant was how the  group itself transformed it into a tool for interpersonal interaction. If disagree­ ment or argument is an honorable, standard MO in the academy, in the urban  teenagers’ world it was the basis for a fight or a sign of “dissing” your friends. And  when our writers came to the table, disagreement effectively closed down serious  discussion. That is, until the day the teenagers made rival hypothesis thinking  their own tool by renaming it “rivaling” and using the announcement, “I’m just  rivaling,” to initiate energetic, no-threat group discussions. In effect, this trans­ formed mediational tool allowed them to create a new, non-agonistic discourse  for argument that allowed revealing conflicts to be drawn out and discussed.4 As this sketch suggests, an activity lens may reveal the way such influential and  malleable mediational tools are being shaped by and in response to the system they  inhabit. This was evident when other Community Think Tanks were convened  around wider community problems (from the retention and training of low-wage  nursing aids to the social price of revealing a learning disability in high school, to  the culture of stress in college). Here the activity system’s community, represented  by the group at the roundtable, might include nursing home CEOs and supervi­ sors as well as nursing aids, or, in another case, school counselors, teachers, and  teens with a learning disability, or, in yet another, college administrators, faculty,  and first-generation and working students. Facing the demanding task of inter­ cultural and cross-hierarchy deliberation, the institutional dimensions and power  relations shaping these activity systems (i.e., Rules and Roles) suddenly became  more prominent, calling on our “Discourse” tools to mediate the situation in new  ways. This capital D Discourse, as James Gee describes it, provides not simply a vo­ cabulary but a set of “saying (writing)-doing-being-valuing-believing combinations”  that identifies the speaker as a member of a group (526). Differences in status and Discourse, then, tend to authorize not only who speaks  but who is listened to. Here in our Community Think Tanks, rivaling was posi­ tioned as one of the imaginative “language games” everyone was asked to try—and  the roundtable moderators could use it as a laughing challenge to participants. Like  4.	  Interestingly, the research we used on decision making noted that the students  rarely consider more than one option—however, it turns out that adults were not much  better (Johnson 67). 40   Chapter 2 the Briefing Books, this mediational Tool gave voice and standing to marginalized  participants by refusing to privilege the Discourse of policy, giving equal standing  to narrative and the wisdom of experience. And when speakers were prompted to  directly rival themselves, they frequently produced the most insightful counterar­ guments. For example, the human resource manager dealing with discrimination  against a new welfare-to-work employee would propose her own standard, a pro­ fessional HR move (e.g., just tell them to come to me). But when asked to rival that  option, she knew exactly how it would play out—and fail—in the activity system  she knew so well (where experienced employees would get to her first). Meanwhile,  in a classroom, rivaling oneself became a spur to critical thinking and invention that  created usable “working knowledge” (Flower, “Intercultural Knowledge Building. Another example of a mediational tool which offers a lens on learning out­ comes, is the reflective writing many teachers use to support learning and trans­ fer (Yancey, “Introduction”).5 In Rebecca Nowacek’s classroom study of transfer as  “recontextualization,” reflection in the from of lively discussions helped students  to “integrate” their learning across different classes. Written reflection can reveal  not only interactions and conflict within a learner’s activity system but can reshape  those interactions as well. For example, the cognitive process of writing is often  5.	  It is important to note that the notion of reflection, which will come up in other  cases, is a bit of a merry-go-round. Pick the color of your horse and it will take you up  and down through the disciplines. In writing, one of the most useful reviews of reflection  in varied contexts is Kathleen Blake Yancy’s A Rhetoric of Reflection. Later when she ex­ pands reflective practice to assessment and digital portfolios in “It’s Tagmemics and the  Sex Pistols,” she reminds us that “we have multiple definitions [of reflection]—ranging  from metacognition, account of process, and self-assessment to synthesis, rhetorical ex­ planation, and exploration” (268). For instance, the many guides to “critical reflection” in  education ask writers to identify, question and assess their deeply held assumptions often  with the intent to improve self-understanding or learning. But as it moves into communi­ ty engagement, it also becomes a tool for cultural critique, to uncover social assumptions  and practices that support oppression. Here an important distinction Gholdy Muhammad  would make notes that criticality is more than just critical thinking. It is critical thinking  about power, justice, equity, humanity, problem-solving, empowerment, marginalization  and other criticality-related topics (84) Some approaches to reflection outside our field have developed even more formal  frameworks for analysis and training. In a relevant account of “experiential learning,”  which David Kolb describes as a “continuing inquiry into the nature of experience and  the process of learning from it “(xviii), Kolb compares the Lewinian model of “action  research and laboratory training” with a more familiar Deweyan “model of learning.” In a  relevant comparison, he notes how Lewin starts with observation while Dewey’s process  begins with purpose (32-33). A related methodology from sociology called “critical reflec­ tion,” often draws on Jack Mezirow’s theory of high-level transformative learning, which  is widely used in adult education and human resource development. It is interesting to  note, in Henriette Lungren and Rob Poell’s detailed literature review of this model, they  discovered “little agreement on how to operationalize reflection” (3). Creating Personal Outcomes  41 riddled with conflict (especially in better writers) as writers try to negotiate incom­ patible or competing expectations, conventions, personal goals and so on, while  depending on habitual but sometimes poorly adapted strategies. The educational  challenge is giving them a look at or insight into this drama. In a study with college  students, we had used the tool of a data-based reflective analysis to let students track  their own extended processes of creating a final paper. The data they collected from  self-interviews, collaborative planning sessions, notes, and drafts revealed a crowd  of internal and external voices giving them directions, which in turn emerged from  their competing representations of the task, context, and often their own shifting  goals. In response to these new insights, the students were able to articulate a virtual  kaleidoscope of their own working theories and habitual but sometimes limited  strategies for dealing with dilemmas (Flower, “What Does Cognitive”). One obvi­ ous outcome here for students was the development of a new sort of metaknowl­ edge about themselves as writers and the ability to make more conscious choices.  For me, the teacher, this lens offered new insight into students’ “writing problems”  and assumptions I could not have inferred. Using this form of written reflection has  shaped both students’ writing and my teaching (Flower, Construction 290). In the following case, we will use two tools, the theoretical lens of activity  systems and the mediational tool of data-based reflection to demonstrate a way to  glimpse some of the outcomes of an engaged course as they are located in activity  systems beyond the classroom. What We Observed Over the course of the last 20 years, the Carnegie Mellon Community Think  Tanks developed an expanded set of discourse practices and mediational tools.6  What the more recent Leadership, Dialogue, and Change course added to the  set was a final four-page Personal Inquiry which asked students to “consolidate  [your] best thinking on the rhetoric of leadership, dialogue, and change” and how  it could be and was actually being applied to students’ own experience. 6.	  The projects and courses discussed throughout this book draw on a number of  educational Tools—named practices that grew out of our research in cognitive rhetoric.  These were then used and developed in CMU classes, at the Community Literacy Center  and later in the Think Tanks. Ones mentioned here include Collaborative Planning (Flow­ er, Construction, Flower, et. al. Making Thinking Visible) the Rival Hypothesis Stance or  Rivaling (Flower, Long, Higgins), Problem Analysis, Stories-Behind-the-Story, Options  and Outcomes (Flower, “Intercultural Knowledge,” Community Literacy). In addition, some more theoretical notions (which were explicitly taught as expert ac­ tions, not just ideas) included Task Representation (Flower, et.al. Reading-to-Write), the  Planner’s Blackboard, Transforming Writer-Based Prose (Flower, Problem-Solving Strat­ egies), Metacognitive Awareness of Problems, and Generative Conflict (Flower, Construc­ tion; “Difference-Driven Inquiry,” “Hidden Frames”) and Intercultural Inquiry (Flower,  Community Literacy). 42   Chapter 2 This final reflection, focused on application became an essential part of the  course, assigned as an inquiry on the principle that students remember what they  have taught-to and articulated-for themselves, especially in writing. The analysis  in Table 2.1 operates on the assumption that students’ ability to embed course  content in their own activity systems is a strong indicator of learning and of how  it is represented in their own experience. The analysis in Table 2.1 used the lens  of activity theory (its Rules, Roles, and Tools) and the tool of reflection to build a  bottom-up coding scheme designed to capture some ways students had translat­ ed the course experience into socially embedded thinking within activity systems  outside class. The categories (created from reading these papers) name a set of  sites students referred to when they wrote about how their learning has been  applied. Their areas of application ranged from interpreting their own perfor­ mance to understanding concepts, treating genres as actions, and shaping per­ sonal goals. As you can see, most students worked in only some of these areas, but  overall, the nature of their representations document some distinctive outcomes  of socially engaged learning. Table 2.1.

An excellent student, her paper was a fine review of ideas attributed to  sources but applied to abstract, undeveloped examples. Student 2, on the other  hand—an experienced African American college activist working on her MA— starts her reflection with an anecdote from her own experience two months ear­ lier with a local action group trying to reduce gun violence in Pittsburgh’s inner  city. However, she says, it was the Leadership, Dialogue, and Change course that  “taught me how to re-define leadership as it relates to everyday people” and gave  her insight into how they “could indeed make a tangible and provocative dif­ ference in their communities.” Comments such as these, for example, would be  coded as a #4 (defining concepts) and a #1 (own performance). More revealing, though, is her account of learning “how to enter a multipli­ cative discourse with claims that have existed before me.” The meaning of this  assertion emerges in her account of an intellectual and experiential dilemma “in  the move from reading and writing to action and writing . . . I felt a tension  arise between my own ideological conceptions of problems and relating these ab­ stractions to real, living audiences.” She compares walking into the action group  “thinking I was well-versed in community and police relations [which, in com­ parison to most college students, she was] and later beginning our Think Tank  interviews with Independent (first-generation working) students.” Here too, she  entered the conversation “with my own assumptions on how interviewees would  feel and which problems they would find most important. Being an ‘independent’  student myself, I assumed that I was in the know. I was wrong.” In this account, we see Student 2 translating her new understanding into lo­ cal, rhetorical action and into a practice of leadership that confronts conflict even  as it as it challenges her own habits and assumptions. Her text also suggests the  intention to carry this new understanding forward after this class. Invoking Cor­ nel West, David Coogan, and Ronald Heifetz, she describes using Think Tank  practices as mediational tools: first, in her own activist work with Black teens, to  uncover “situated knowledge” about cops with 14-year-old Tyvontae, and second­ ly, to “manage difficult people” at her own Think Tank roundtable. She describes  the discovery of “useful methods for navigating . . . the transition from ideology  to action . . . creating conversations with real audiences that bridge the gap be­ tween learning from literature and learning from the experiential knowledge of  everyday people.” An impressive outcome by any standard. Perhaps it is not surprising to see this socially engaged student so conscious­ ly connecting her coursework to a social/cultural/cognitive activity system in  which her learning is embedded. So it is useful to look at Student 3, whose equal­ ly self-conscious engagement with conflict takes the form of trying to design a  guide for his teaching. As a first-year PhD student, Student 3 locates his personal  inquiry, in fine academic manner, in “what I’ve observed to be a sort of ‘generative  dichotomy’ in the literature on leadership” from Emerson and Freire to Alinsky  and hooks. The question is, should a leader be raising consciousness or moving  44   Chapter 2 people to action? This intellectual dilemma is rather dramatically transformed,  however, as he continues, “I struggled with trying to reconcile this dichotomy not  only through reading our course materials, but especially as I was transitioning  into a new leadership role as a first-year writing instructor this semester.” He narrates an open-ended story of trying—and failing—to help a student  who had already failed the first-year course before. Taking our work on dealing  with setbacks directly into their one-on-one meetings, he discovered that this  “promising idea” of laying the issues out was increasingly perturbing. He noticed  that “somehow, simply naming these problems seemed to make things more in­ timidating for this student.” In retrospect (recalling the other class-derived prac­ tices of building a network of support and a plan for action), he envisions “one  way that I could have potentially helped [the student] overcome this intimidation  would be to suggest different types of strategies for action, rather than merely  laying out what the current problems were.” For him, learning is transformed  into the aspirations for his own teaching career: “It’s my ultimate hope that I can  integrate this strategy into my own leadership praxis and teaching, as well—that  I can strike the delicate balance of helping my students name the problems facing  them without foreclosing the possibility of productive action and success.” Asking students to reflect on the uses to which they have put their learning  can give us insight into how they actively transformed what they were “taught” in  order to enter a new Community and adapt to a new situation, or demands and  conflicts in the Roles, Rules, or Tools of its activity system. Perhaps more impor­ tantly, it draws the writer into what appears to be an ongoing, open-ended path of  inquiry into meaningful consequences. These action-focused reflections become  useful tools for enlarging the learning agendas students set for themselves in sub­ sequent courses. Using the lens of activity theory to examine these data-driven reflections let  me articulate how my students were transforming learning into practice. And it  shows how engagement beyond the readings and classroom was pushing them  into adapting old, constructing new, and testing out mediational tools. And they  are doing so in challenging situations that vary from eliciting insider information  from a teenager to managing “difficult people” to mentoring a failing student. At  the same time, they are themselves reflectively, expansively confronting issues of  status and power while digging into contradictions in their own social practice  and thinking. The next educational step beyond this outcome, which I would  call constructing new understanding and open questions, is to discuss such results  with the students and find ways to put the evidence of this learning outcome into  wider circulation. Adapting Methods Both these methods work in a wide variety of contexts. As the subtitle of John  Flanagan’s 1954 article on “The Critical Incident Technique” puts it, it was “A  Creating Personal Outcomes  45 Technique for Investigating Problematic Activities from Multiple Perspectives.”  (It first proved its worth in 1941 by discovering why 1,000 pilot candidates were  failing the flight test. Turns out it was the design of the instrument panel.) In a  little more recent example of how it could be used, nursing training has some  institutionally defined goals around “caring” and for turning experience into  working knowledge. However, these hard to track professional skills are essential  to assessing the effectiveness of the training. And STEM courses (typically fo­ cused on professional methods and those outcomes) frequently assign teamwork  projects—but rarely teach teamwork as a professional skill. In this case, Craig  Moreau turned to tracking teamwork strategies and their outcomes in some high  performing professional workplaces (Teams). Focused on “teams that innovate,”  he not only discovered the powerful effect of “productive conflict” but built it into  a classroom and online teaching guide, which he then tested in an experimental  study—in which the power of productive conflict achieved statistical significance  (Teaching). A fine example of integrating multiple methods. Activity analysis would be an ideal tool for tracking students moving from a  class or training program to a socially complex situation such as an internship,  research project, or local organization. How much of that activity system, with its  Rules, Roles, and Tools and how much of its Community and Goals are they as a  Subject aware of and interacting with? Is there evidence of Engeström’s “expan­ sive transformation”? To reap the benefit of this analysis, you might also create  a space for the class or group to use these categories to code their own written  reflections, in order to discuss what they made of this analysis for themselves. 47 Chapter 3. Outcomes with a Public Face The two cases in Chapter 2 revealed learning outcomes which may normally re­ main unseen. Some were surprising outcomes in which students transferred and  even transformed what the combination of new ideas and experience had offered  them to problematic personal, professional, and public lives. There, Case 1 sug­ gested how a simple research tool, such as comparing easily coded critical inci­ dent interviews to what we hoped to teach, can give a clear measure of transfer  to real-life situations. Case 2 drew on the rich, theoretically based tool of activity  analysis to locate explicit instances of transfer in the social, cultural, cognitive  context of an activity system. And in that case, when students worked out their  own interpretations of outcome data, their collaborative work of tracking and  discussing transformation became in itself a revealing educational experience— for everyone. Here, we turn to two cases in which engaged education can create  a different set of public-facing outcomes. Despite their importance, they are also  often more challenging to track. Case 1: Altering Institutional Practice This case returns to the Independent Student Think Tank (Chapter 2, Case 2) with  a much harder challenge: how do you track a public impact, if there is any, that a  course actually has? When the search for consequence shifts to the larger context  of an institution or a community, we tend to ask, what is transferred: a report, an  assessment, a tool, a program, and how? We can, of course, point to the literal  publication of a text or the transfer of a “deliverable.” On the other hand, tracking  the less tangible outcomes, such as the possible impact of an altered discourse or  the way a problem is framed, may require us to shift both our expectations and  our methods. Like a tracker, we may need scatter vision to detect subtle move­ ments in the trees, or the close, patient focus that eventually discerns the faint  impression of a hoof. Many service projects do indeed see tangible, short-term  effects and have developed a battery of useful tools to access attitudes and skills.  However, the consequences of rhetorical engagement, of inquiry, and of deliber­ ation are unlikely to be either direct or immediate. To begin with, such outcomes  are neither defined nor produced according to our design specs but created ac­ cording to the needs of our institutional or community partners. Unlike work  teams or policymakers crafting coordinated action, the intentionally diverse set  of folks who participate in community conversations, for instance, do so with the  distinctive agendas dictated by their own activity system, and they go back home  to its established set of goals, tasks, and practices. So the outcome—beyond the  value of creating dialogue in the first place—is typically to be found in terms of  each partner’s own home agenda. 48   Chapter 3 The Case As the rhetorical exigence for the Community Literacy Center’s Impact Report  to funders suggested (Chapter 2, Case 1) showed, we may need to invent new,  more-sensitive indicators of transformation and the categories of meaningful  change that both students and collaborators can see. For example, in Because We  Live Here, Eli Goldblatt’s engaging, influential narrative of university/community  program-building, he describes a year-long series of energetic coffeehouse con­ versations and plans with a community organizer from which the only apparent  result was mutual insight and a strong relationship. No project emerged from  those conversations, as urgent issues in the organizer’s work took precedent. So  why did their meaningful dialogue count as a significant outcome? Likewise, Elenore Long’s case studies open up the rarely studied, often-ex­ tended process she calls “early uptake”—the initial rhetorical art of listening and  finding one’s place in a community or local public (A Responsive Rhetorical Art).  It’s the work of figuring out, as Jeffrey Grabill puts it, “how to be useful” (Grabill  193). “Co-constructed among strangers . . . diverse stakeholders, value system, in­ terests, practices and purpose,” this responsive “attentive rhetoricity . . . signals a  shared stance within public dialogue that engaged the demands of contemporary  public life” (Long, Responsive 15-16). But in this case, being useful stood in sharp  contrast to the expected outcomes of a university outreach program. The com­ munity was a disorganized, physically, socially and linguistically divided body of  refugees from the Sudanese diaspora who had been relocated to Phoenix. And the  strategies its women employed to navigate these transnational social worlds were  often criticized as maladaptive by the professionals, such as educational adminis­ trators who design academic “outreach” programs that reflect structural require­ ments for assimilation. And that was the outcome Long supposedly should have  been achieving. However, her “early uptake” attention to women’s lives suggested  that it was not the women but the traditional institutional interventions that were  out of synch with their reality (see Chapter 6 for what early uptake did achieve). Stepping into such a vortex, the community educator is not only trying to  find her own place but also trying to help create a place to work from—i.e., an  inclusive, multilingual, deliberative network where people can find their voice,  define their own agenda, and achieve small victories and incremental changes  through collaborative inquiry and support. It takes the stance Long describes as  a responsive rhetorical art—a techné of eliciting and interpreting a group’s real  concerns—to discover useful ways to enter. For educators like Long, milestones  and outcomes on this nonlinear path can take unexpected shapes, such as learn­ ing how to artfully negotiate hurdles that the city’s outreach programs them­ selves put in the way of actually useful learning—while at the same time facing  somewhat similar cultural tensions within the South Sudanese diaspora. As Long  documents, the ability to progressively influence these assumptions and support  new frameworks for being useful may have longer-lasting consequences than the  Outcomes with a Public Face  49 more-visible outcome of mounting a traditional “literacy” project. But how do  you go public with extra-institutional outcomes like these? Do they count? Another potential category of hard to see outcomes to consider are the recip­ rocal ones in which both partners are discovering/sharing something. The title  of Eli Goldblatt and David Jolliffe’s book, Literacy as Conversation: Learning Net­ works in Urban and Rural Communities names the underlying dynamic. Gold­ blatt quotes,  James Britton’s (1995, 140) brilliant phrase “shaping at the point  of utterance” which as he says, “sets up a demand for further  shaping.” And for the kids coming to Philadelphia’s non-prof­ it community Tree House, it “affords a space for ‘shaping’ that  involves composing and interpreting, speaking and listening in  the company of others. Conversation, both written and oral . . .  draws people together into mutually respectful relations”. And  in this case, “over the years, easily a hundred college students  interacted with Tree House children and parents, plus hundreds  of others the organization touches.” (69) Just as Long used her community participation to conceptualize the nature  of a responsive art and design new forms of engagement, the projects Jennifer  Clifton describes were designed to call a deliberative public of students and var­ ious community partners into being. She sketches a reciprocal alternative to the  way argument is taught in English language arts and first year composition class­ rooms. Describing the contrast between a genre-driven practice of text produc­ tion and the “public listening” that marks successful publics, she then sketches  an alternative educational model of argument. The goal in this model is not to  produce a formally supported “argument” but to orchestrate a literal “dialogue  across difference.” But this, which this was not what her department expected,  created a controversy The question, of course, is how do dialogues such as these lead to both per­ sonal and visible positive institutional change? On that path, two potent-yet-of­ ten-indirect outcomes of dialogue depend, first, on moving both partners into the  stance of inquiry—that open-ended recognition that there are significant things  we don’t know and need to discover. And this, in turn, can lead to an internal  “reframing” of our knowledge, which emerged in light of inquiry. Rhetoricians  of all stripes strive to strategically “reframe” issues for an audience in the name  of a public good or self-interest. Although in our case, the goal is to reframe by  discovering what we didn’t know in the first place. As we will see in Chapter 4,  discussions across race and differences in the internal, situated knowledge each  partner may possess can be an enormous, unrecognized, unarticulated barrier. In this context, one of strongest arguments for a theoretically grounded  methodology that is designed not just to create new “knowledge” but to also  drive social change comes from Aja Y. Martinez in her chapter called, “A Case  50   Chapter 3 for Counterstory.” As she explains it in the context of community engagement  around race, this “critical race methodology includes a range of methods such  as family history, biography, autoethnography, cuentos, testimonios, and coun­ terstory (3). The technique, however, is secondary to its driving premise: this  methodology “recognizes that experiential knowledge of people of color is le­ gitimate and critical to understanding racism that is often well disguised in  the rhetoric of normalized structural values and practices” (3). This disguise  matters because: a majoritarian story distorts and silences the experiences of  people of color and others distanced from the norms such sto­ ries reproduce. A standardized majoritarian methodology relies  on stock stereotypes that covertly and overtly link people of col­ or, women of color, and poverty with “bad,” while emphasizing  that white, middle- and/or upper-class people embody all that  is “good.” (23) When the outcome of discovery is not merely information but the substantive  reframing of a method of inquiry as she describes it, the impact can be both  far-reaching and shared. In all of these studies, we see an array of non-materi­ al outcomes that emerge through talk, through social networks, and over time.  Evaluating such outcomes will call for attunement to what John Dewey calls pro­ gressive “ends-in-view” rather than a fixed end or the point where activity ceases  (“Nature of Aims”). And since institutional outcomes are rarely articulated as  such, how can we recognize and argue for anything like a public, sociocultural  “consequential transition” (Beach)? Using the Lenses of Circulation, Conflict and Framing. I admit to an academic attachment to measuring outcomes in terms of written  documents, data, or organized public projects; these are satisfying and often in­ fluential. But a closer analysis of less obvious indicators—such as those Goldblatt,  Long, Clifton, and Martinez describe—could reveal another level of meaning­ ful learning for all of their participants. Studies of how rhetorically influenced  change happens in publics and in organizations, for instance, would direct our at­ tention to three areas in particular: expanding the reach of circulation, respond­ ing to sites of conflict, and, creating the new interpretive frames that build social  networks. One of the powerful ways rhetoric infiltrates a public and nudges change is  through the circulation of ideas and identities. Circulation whether in print, me­ dia, tweets, or conversation—creates publics (not to be confused with the demo­ graphic models of publics created by marketers) (Hauser). A public, as Michael  Warner so memorably argues in Publics and Counterpublics, is created by mere  attention which says, “Not only ‘Let a public exist’ but let it have this character,  Outcomes with a Public Face  51 speak this way, see the world this way . . . Run it up the flagpole and see who  salutes” (114). One important outcome of educating for engagement would be  whether such a public is created, and if so, what exactly has your action put into  circulation? And why does it matter? As we saw in Engeström’s model of activity analysis (Chapter 2, Case 2), the  potential for and the sites of change are often found in those jagged lines in Figure  2.2 that mark “contradictions” (“Developmental”). These are points of tension  within a system or between alternative systems—whether the conflict is articulat­ ed and acknowledged or not. For example, the comfortable structures of habitus,  such as standard institutional practices for informing students about loan regu­ lations, normally do serve a purpose for someone. Yet they may be at odds with  the support others who don’t fit the norm, such as Independent students, actually  need. And authority may be so fragmented across a university system that a more  inclusive, coordinated plan is unlikely to emerge. However, it is these very points  of contradiction in the system, Engeström argues, that offer openings and sites  for change—when they are acknowledged. And as his research with healthcare  providers and teachers shows, such recognition may only come after multiple  flags are run up by persistent calls for attention (Engeström “Developmental”;  “Teachers”). So what kinds of thinking can rhetoric put into circulation that will support  the recognition of contradiction, conflict, and the need to change? First, un­ like the more tangible innovations other disciplines can boast, these communi­ ty-based deliberative events can be intentionally designed to draw out competing  representations, assumptions, and values, as well as the conflicts they engender— to create a space for generative conflict. And in doing so, as in political or policy  discourse, they often go beyond producing information to actually constructing  and circulating new frames for thinking with. As policy analysts put it so well,  by “socially constructing the problem situation, a frame ‘provides conceptual co­ herence, a direction for action, a basis for persuasion, and a framework for the  collection and analysis of data—order, action, rhetoric, and analysis’” (Rein and  Schoen, qtd. in Fischer 144). As discursive constructions designed to do “mean­ ing work,” these new frames are unlike widely shared schemas or cultural “tool  kits” already supplied by ideology, narratives, or myths. Rather, such frames are  actively negotiated shared meanings that not only identify problems and possible  solutions but motivate a response, creating a call to arms and a vocabulary of  motive (Benford and Snow 613-618). As these new guides to interpretation circulate through academic and com­ munity dialogue, they are also creating a local public, a newly constituted body  of people paying attention, maybe even widening the scope of the public through  talk, text, or citation. (Perhaps even this published discussion will extend the pub­ lic drawn together around recognizing, investigating, and discussing the nature  of some overlooked educational outcomes? Perhaps the frame of an “Indepen­ dent” versus an “at-risk” or “under-prepared” student could reshape our image of  52   Chapter 3 the problem?) So an alternative way to follow the tracks of circulation is to map  not only the “reading public” as Warner does but also the social networks being  created: who is now talking to whom, and what is the topic of this potentially “re­ framed” conversation? In organizational studies, it has become a commonplace  understanding that the coordination of work is typically negotiated in employ­ ee networks. Moreover, diversified personal networks improve performance and  promote learning and innovation in the organization (Cross and Parker). Is it  possible that community engagement gives academics a way to build new net­ works for us, our students, and partners. Social media has an unprecedented power to create reading publics and social  networks; however, as Phyllis Ryder points out, social media does not create “de­ liberative” publics. Described in Ryder’s beautifully observed account of a non­ profit kitchen and support center for homeless folks, the savvy social networking  of Miriam’s Kitchen succeeds at what we expect—getting donations. However,  Ryder shows how those exchanges achieve something more for their white, mid­ dle-class readers: their astute rhetorical work . . . brings fans, followers and their networks  together as a public, one that adopts a particular attitude toward  the conditions of homelessness, a particular understanding  of their capacity to address those conditions, and a particular  mode of interacting around those concerns. (Public 2.0 36) When we look even further beyond a local site to the public writing emerging  from community action, we can see not only multiple discourses but competing  visions of democracy (Ryder Rhetorics). Much of the research I’ve referred to calls on a variety of formal, sophisticated  ways to conduct analyses of activity systems and their contradictions, patterns of  circulation, frames, and intertextual references. In doing so, these formal studies  both capture the ways ideas and practices morph and how they map the intricate  links of social networks. My argument here, however, is that these concepts—such  as activity systems, circulation, frames and intertextuality—can also offer more  informal tools for tracking that can help all of us, students and faculty, better artic­ ulate the consequences of education for engagement and ways to support it. Working in the spirit of grounded-practical theory as described by Robert  Craig and Karen Tracy, such an inquiry would start with a perceived problem. On  a disciplinary level, one such shared problem could be our failure to adequately  articulate the impact of engagement in a rhetorically based education. At a more  situated level—in this case, the Community Think Tank described in Chapter  2—the problem emerged as a contradiction within university practice. It seemed  that the performance and experience of low-income, working, and/or first-gen­ eration (Independent) students was often misinterpreted as a failure on the stu­ dents’ part when perhaps it was simply not on the radar of those who could help.  Unlike attempts to test a hypothesis or apply a pre-defined theoretical paradigm  Outcomes with a Public Face  53 to interpret or critique a live situation, grounded practical-theory building starts  with systematic listening, observing, and documenting. In the case of students organizing this Community Think Tank, ground­ ed-practical-theory building took the form of a difference-driven inquiry that  collected critical incidents and alternative readings of what the “problem” really  was, which could then be put in revealing dialogue with each other. Their own  next step was a reconstruction or interpretation (a theory or normative ideal) of  these situated accounts which met the constraint of being actually useful. This  practical interpretive reconstruction, Craig and Tracy remind us, is not presum­ ing to solve the problem but may, in fact, reveal uncertainty, unresolved tension,  or even a counterfactual ideal—one which, as they found, might raise a “very  basic question that has hardly been explored at all” (267). What We Observed The obvious sorts of milestones that mark the Think Tank’s public life and its  entry into a university’s activity system emerged over a period of 22 years, just  as the Community Literacy Center had evolved. Seen in retrospect, the CLC’s  model of community conversations progressively turned into more elaborately  documented, deliberative, problem-solving projects published in reports and in  training materials on the web and in new course curricula. Some of these re­ sulting projects also became more clearly action oriented. Our Decision Maker’s  Guide for Peer Mentoring, for instance, was designed for students to talk through  problems investigated in previous Think Tank Findings. You could say we “recon­ stituted” our grounded discoveries into a more “practical” or useful form, which  we began to test with campus advisory groups. Some indications of useful consequences were encouragingly direct, such as  the letter our university president received from the president of a local African  American union. It described the Think Tank experience as “tremendously ben­ eficial to [his] personal growth and to the efficacy and prowess of [the union].”  The union leader also credited the Think Tank with preparing union members to  participate in an upcoming district analysis of its institution’s troubled promo­ tional process. However, like many public deliberations, Think Tanks typically perform like  a wheel in which every spoke (every participant) looks toward a shared deliber­ ative center but is anchored to its home place on the rim—and that’s where the  real outcomes are located. Public recognition of a project is far less significant  than the subsequent uses to which it is put by individuals. The knowledge, frames  or practices we put into circulation did not simply transfer but had to be trans­ formed into innovations or adaptations integrated into the practice of a counselor,  a professor, or an administrator. And unlike crafted publicity, the path of circula­ tion is often serendipitous, depending less on websites and publications than on  email exchanges, meetings with administrators, and informal talk. 54   Chapter 3 In the cases sketched here, perhaps the most critical things put into circula­ tion were some practical frames for thinking with and acting upon. In contrast  to the familiar “student life as usual” frame, one new frame that emerged from  the Community Think Tank was an assertion that a “problem” not only exists on  campus, but that we—faculty, staff, and students—are implicated in it. In Gary  Fine and Brooke Harrington’s study of “tiny publics,” frames encourage partici­ pation in civic life by unpacking the meaning of events and making sense of what  we are doing (344). In social movement scholarship, the process of constructing a  collective action frame, heated by the competing schemas and expectations par­ ticipants bring, is frequently a contested one. Yet the very interactive nature of  that process can also result in a “negotiated shared meaning” (Benford and Snow  614). And in Long’s “responsive rhetorical” process, the process can become a way  to seek out “alternative ways of naming this potentially public issue” (189). Frames such as that of the “struggling student” can do this work of ordering  (or re-ordering) our experience into meaningful coherence because they sup­ ply assumptions, implications, and appropriate responses often embedded in  scenarios (Fischer). That all-too-standard “struggling student” frame typically  accounts for late papers, underdeveloped work, or failure to meet financial aid  requirements in terms of academic ability/preparation, failure to take responsi­ bility, or low motivation. It might prompt us to visualize these in the context of a  “warning” meeting in our office. But the Think Tank’s new frame signaled by the  term “Independent students” called up new interpretations; ones that recognized  the achievement of having to manage so many demands “on your own.” It fore­ grounded the challenges of working 20 hours a week on top of classwork or the  difficulty of navigating a complex financial aid system without a knowledgeable  network of support at home or an accessible guide to the labyrinth on campus.  Equally important, it relocated the problem from inside the student to a con­ flict within the system itself. Thinking with such a frame might move us to alter  our next student conference to discuss that late paper’s Story-Behind-the-Story,  or ways to manage deadlines, or how to negotiate those team meetings that get  scheduled during your work shift. Engeström and his colleagues argue that when a group can bring itself to rec­ ognize contradictions within its own activity system, it can open the door to what  they call “expansive transformations”—changes that embrace a larger, multi-fac­ eted reality (“Introduction”). Their argument for describing learning as “expand­ ing” is especially relevant to the workplace contexts they study and to commu­ nity ones. To start with, “learning by expanding” is not limited to changes in  individual cognition or even communication, even though it may often “lead to  self-knowledge and truly widened consciousness” (4). However, “true expansion  is always both internal and external, both mental and material” (7). Beginning  with the recognition of conflict, expansive learning confronts alternatives and  competing positions in order to integrate conflict and contradiction in a new per­ spective. Not limited to mere ideas, this expansive (ongoing) reconceptualization  Outcomes with a Public Face  55 leads to new versions of collective activity and to tools that can, as Engeström  says, push “cycle of the expansive transition forward . . . The practitioners have  the task of facing and solving the contradictions of their activity system as they  are identified and intensified along the voyage through the zone of proximal de­ velopment” (“Activity” 22-23). Now all that may seem a rather large order for a course or community project.  Engeström’s research on “learning-by-expanding” speaks to cases drawn not just  from classrooms and workplaces but also from social movements and the history  of science. Yet activity analysis can help us uncover indicators of this expansive  style of learning that builds a connection to larger activities. So the question be­ comes: is our community-engaged education able to “transcend the context giv­ en” or generate a new material embodiment of our values (“Introduction” 4-5)? We observed ways the roundtables, supported by the voices in Briefing Books,  could provoke the representation of unrecognized conflicts. For example, two  staff members at the Round Table blandly asserted the sufficiency of their of­ fice’s standard financial aid practices (i.e., the information students needed was  posted “somewhere” on their website). However, the Briefing Book already had a  student’s direct response to the inadequacy of this very practice. The discussion  that followed and the subsequent published Findings were able to juxtapose this  apparent contradiction as an invitation to further thought—and concrete change. A related end-in-view could be whether a documented deliberative practice  and its texts put not only ideas and expanded frames but a Discourse, in James  Gee’s sense, into circulation. Here, a Discourse works as one of those mediational  tools that shifts the dynamics of an activity itself. In line with Long’s argument for  an unabashed rhetorical art, the Think Tank named, modeled, and offered how-to  accounts of its tools. Sharing its practice with participants not only offered a ratio­ nale for this difference-driven inquiry but put a Discourse in circulation (Flower,  “Difference-Driven Inquiry”). Its data-based, problem-focused Briefing Books,  mediated roundtables, and rhetorical practices such as rivaling oneself and others  promoted a friendly but focused, self-consciously experimental discourse. One  participant, the head of a hospital division, remarked as he joined in a “rivaling”  strategy session, “We need to try this at our board meetings.” I don’t know if he  did. But circulation can be an unpredictable—if underground—current. Frames and forms of discourse can show up in texts, but perhaps the most  lasting impact in an institution is a network of concern—new relationships  linked by new understandings, which may take unanticipated shapes. Ultimate­ ly the outcomes with the longest reach are the result of an expanding network  of people drawn to a shared concern. For example, serendipity created an early  institutional outcome when a dean in biological science, who valued her par­ ticipation in an earlier set of roundtables in the spring, became the universi­ ty’s vice provost for education in the fall. In the coming year’s administrative  discussions, she was not only knowledgeable about issues the Think Tank had  raised but had already begun thinking about how to address them. In effect, this  56   Chapter 3 connection also gave the Think Tank’s work an informal letter of introduction  to other university administrators. The motivation for an unanticipated uptake by the Financial Aid office shows  up in comments from an interview with the Director: “This all stems from the  Think Tank . . . I was blown away by the dedication of the students at the Think  Tank. I thought that their interest and commitment to the project was amazing. I  left that day and said, ‘We have to do something.’” They did. (And we, of course,  then circulated those comments in a newsletter on campus progress, highlighting  their new approach to offering financial aid.) As should be clear, these outcomes are more subtle than the documentation  that supports a successful marketing campaign. But from an activity point of view,  the ability to put new frames or even a Discourse that speaks to systematic con­ tradictions into circulation, accomplished over time, may be the norm, even if it  is the less recognized road to expansive transformation. And of all the outcomes  engaged educational courses can support, this is probably the hardest to track  but may have the most extensive impact. The challenge is putting new frames,  unarticulated contradictions, and evidence of this uptake itself into circulation. Case 2: Naming the Change You Want to See In this second case, we discovered how a standard academic outcome—a scored,  pre/post evaluation of students’ performance—turned into an opportunity for a  transformative outcome. Six months after the on-campus Decision Makers men­ toring project (sketched in the Introduction) had ended, its high school Scholars  returned to discuss the scored “results” from the pre-test of their decision-mak­ ing. In ways we hadn’t anticipated, they turned that meeting into an opportunity  to recognize and interpret a new aspect of their own growth and identity. In doing  so, they proceeded not only to “rewrite” the meaning of those statistical results  but used the articulated, situated knowledge they created to construct a new im­ age of their own path forward. The Case Like many community projects, the Community Literacy Center (Chapter 2,  Case 1) was not conceived to be institutionalized but to explore ways to make a  visible difference through locally adapted, evolving, and transformable practices.  Ten years later, the Decision Makers project took that philosophy and its associ­ ated practices to campus as part of a new course: Literacy: Educational Theory  and Community Practice.1 The course combined reading research and studies in  1.	   Stacie Dojonovic of the Pittsburgh Public Schools had created the remarkable Start  On Success program for these students.  I was exceptionally  fortunate to work with her  and later Ashley McFall to engage these students. Outcomes with a Public Face  57 literacy with mentoring junior and senior high school students with a learning  disability as they wrote about decision-making in their own lives. In the Deci­ sion Makers project, the earlier CLC practice of prompting teens to talk about  complex problems moved into the university computer lab. Paired with our high  school students one-on-one, the “Mentors” supported their Scholars (as the high  school students were identified) in writing a personal Decision Maker’s Journey  Book. The booklet, which sported a self-designed personal-identity cover, was  comprised of three chapters, all challenging the Scholars to describe and evaluate  their own decisions. The first chapter asked them to describe a good decision,  a bad decision, and an imagined alternative to the bad one. (That last part on  alternatives was written after a revealing, often hilarious, session in which the  other students—who didn’t yet know how the story ended—tried to predict what  the writer did do, good or bad, then brainstormed options he or she could have  considered. It sent a powerful, often-needed message that a person did have al­ ternatives). In the second chapter, the Scholars tried out different decision-mak­ ing strategies (such as seeking rivals or imagining consequences) to analyze a  difficult decision they were currently facing. Finally, in the last chapter, Scholars  composed a self-addressed letter detailing where they wanted to be in their lives  six months in the future. To write their Journey Book, Mentors and Scholars used a computer program  we designed called the Decision Makers Guide (Decision Makers). This on-line  Guide served three purposes: first, in addition to the online Journey Book Guide,  the program allowed us to collect and score a set of pre-and-post “Starting Point”  and “Check Point Profiles,” designed to gauge the sophistication of the Scholars’  decision-making. Second, it offered a template in WORD for writing their Jour­ ney Book. In addition, by posing questions and offering generic prompts in the  margins of each online chapter, it incited the high schoolers to think critically  about their decisions and decision-making as they were writing—and in the pro­ cess, learn a key set of decision-making strategies (e.g., naming the problem, giv­ ing reasons and rivals, facing roadblocks, and using focused reflection).2 Finally,  the computer program enabled the Scholars to print out their own Journey Books,  replete with charts and tables visualizing the Scholars’ growing decision-making  skills over the course of the project. High school students with different sorts of learning disabilities face both  learning and social identity problems. As we discovered in a Community Think  Tank on “Naming the LD Difference: Dilemmas in Dealing with Learning  2.	  A link to Decision Makers (found on the front page of the Think Tank website)  gives users access to the seven steps in writing a Journey Book, writing prompts, and links  to supportive pages for writing each chapter (“CMU Community Think Tank”). Unlike  papers assigned as a course requirement this data from collaborating with public schools  was covered with a University Child Protection Form, Letter to Parent or Guardian, and  IRB clearance. 58   Chapter 3 Disabilities” held with students, school administrators, teachers, and counsel­ ors, the disclosure of an LD is a double-edged sword. Getting institutional help  brings with it the stigma of incompetence, causing students to go under cover  with teachers and peers (Flower, “Going Public”). (Yet that Think Tank also re­ vealed a dramatically new public stance a Scholar from a previous Decision Mak­ ers was now ready to take.) Beyond stigma, traditional forms of evaluation, with  which the students are so familiar, are designed to certify what a student can’t do  and reinforce a standard of normalcy (Mehan). So in addition to helping these  students articulate some of their own strengths in print, it was important for the  Decision Makers project to show the Scholars’ schools, parents, and employers  real evidence of the Scholars’ growth and competence in a critical adult capa­ bility—decision-making. Accordingly, I use this case to demonstrate how some  traditional tools of statistical evaluation can produce evidence—but in this case  for the purpose of showing what students can do. Using Coding and Statistics    To track the changes in the Scholars’ decision-making skills over the course of  the project, we also asked each student to create a Starting Point Profile, done in  the initial writing session, and a Check Point Profile, done roughly nine months  later. Both Profiles—which asked the Scholars reflect on their internal and exter­ nal strengths—started with a survey of the students’ Network of Support (people  to whom they could turn for help and advice), followed by a multiple-choice “As­ set Assessment” of personal resources (ranging from connections with one’s com­ munity to a history of dealing with peer pressure or thinking through hard choic­ es).3 More important for the evaluation of their decision making, the Profiles also  asked Scholars to think about five areas of their experience (from education to  personal relationships, using money and personal time to physical, emotional,  and sexual health) and then briefly respond in writing to three questions related  to each area: 1) what are your goals, problems, or values in this area; followed by  2) what are the changes you are working toward; and 3) finally, what steps are you  taking to get there? We designed these prompts to gauge their ability to articulate a decision at in­ creasing levels of sophistication. And as the Check Point Profile was not a memory  test, a short reminder of the decision-making strategies we had discussed during  the project appeared in the sidebar (see Appendix 3,1 for details). Our coding—test­ ed for reliability—of replies to the three questions was straightforward. It gave its  top score to a “Reasoned, Reflective Decision.” This was an account of their decision  that included “Reasons,” “Specifics” (rather than generalizations), “Rivals” (alterna­ tives or reasons against), “Consequences,” and/or “Conditions” (including possible  3.	  The asset questions were drawn from the research of the Search Institute (searchin- stitute.org) on the assets associated with healthy personal development and behaviors. Outcomes with a Public Face  59 “Roadblocks”) and “Qualifications”). A good but more limited decision at the next  level was coded as “Supports Action/Developed,” followed by a “Commonsense/ General” account, down to a “None/No Fit” option (see Appendix 3.2). Focused, informal research like this allows the researcher to show progress,  make comparisons, and raise good questions. Unlike a more general qualitative  analysis or a grade, it can identify specific, if challenging, actions or rhetorical  moves an educator is working toward and share them with the students. In the  context of this case study, it required a meaningful pre-and-post writing task  and an explicit coding scheme that could identify the presence or absence of the  decision-making moves we were teaching. The computer program made scoring  the moves (and checking for them with another coder) easy. The coding ru­ bric (on which co-coders achieved a significant 80% reliability) let us translate  the score into four levels of sophistication in Reflective Decision Making, noted  above. Then, the results were turned into a readable bar graph comparing pos­ sible and actual scores, as well as a pie chart showing the percent of comments  each student was making at each level (see Appendix 3l2). This report was then  available to each Scholar. Making Sense of the Results This use of straightforward statistical data differs in important ways from  formal educational research. Unlike a well-designed experiment using the re­ sults to test the effectiveness of a specific teaching method, for instance, there  is no control group and far too many variables in this small sample to make a  statistically significant claim for either our methods or community engagement.  (Maybe the gains in decision-making ability we saw in the students’ Check Point  Profiles were just the effects of maturation?) But informal research like this pro­ vides the kind of evidence that, given a clear focus and a coding rubric tested  for reliability, can support a strong, reasoned argument. In this case, it is an  argument for socially engaged learning and its ability to combine its focus on  a critical adult skill such as decision-making with a small (but mighty) set of  moves (e.g., giving reasons and specific details, rivaling, considering roadblocks,  conditions and qualifications). These moves, drawn from research on writing,  argumentation, and decision-making, were then named, discussed, and applied  to decisions meaningful to the writer in a mentored, social experience. If we can  combine this explicit focus with a significant change in the teenagers’ ability to  articulate their own thinking about a decision, we have a strong argument for  a genuinely useful outcome—based here on the lens of documentation. In the  present case, this visible, statistical evidence let us make a strong public state­ ment about the thoughtful problem-solving capabilities of these students. And,  unlike an experimental study, it made little difference whether we proved that  our program was the sole cause or not. Especially for these students it was the  demonstrated outcome that mattered. 60   Chapter 3 However, at this point an additional “engaged” analysis let us go beyond a stan­ dard statistical lens to an interpretive one, based on an interactive inquiry with the  Scholars (which also triangulated our interpretations). This collaborative analysis  began when we invited that year’s cohort of Scholars to return campus to discuss  their personal scores and compare their school’s score to other schools. The goal of  the meeting was to explore why the personal and group scores differed, from their  insider perspective. The questions on the table were “How do you interpret your  results?”, “What did you mean when you wrote that?”, “Why is it these various dif­ ferences exist (where you scored high on one area or low in another, or between you  and other students, or between schools)?”, “What do you think your decision-mak­ ing looks like now, six months later?”, and “What would you like to change?” Bring­ ing this additional interpretive lens to the data had some unexpected outcomes. A collaborative, interpretive lens complements and complicates the initial re­ sults by refusing to take the numbers, scores, and statistical patterns at face value  as comprehensive indicators of growth. Instead, it uses that data as the ground for  inquiry into a fuller understanding. The results of the scoring posed an interpre­ tive problem to be solved: what did a student’s written responses actually mean?  What was behind that? Where is the opening for change or growth? Approaching  the data through a collaborative group analysis asked the Scholars themselves to  take on the job of interpreting what the Profile questions meant in their context.  What choices did their scores reflect? How would (would?) seeing other options  affect their plans for action and change? Each of these ways of using statistics to look at outcomes has its own strength.  But used together, they show us how engaged learning can build a public case for  its outcomes and at the same time push all its partners to articulate new insights.  The challenge is designing an assessment that retains the persuasive, visual, and  circulatory power of statistics but without the goal of ranking the intellectual  or personal worth of some above others. Rather, it is a tool for an experientially  grounded reflection that affirms students’ dignity and potential. What We Observed The Power of Documentation and Numbers This form of tracking had two distinctive outcomes. The most obvious was the  ability to create a visually persuasive documentation of growth in a highly valued  adult ability: to make reasoned and reflective decisions in the face of significant  choices. The use of focused documentation and coding let us create four repre­ sentations of student performance: 1.	 The number of people in a student’s Support Network—for whom they  could offer a reason why that person mattered. 2.	 A bar graph showing each Scholar’s self-rated level of social, experiential  Assets (e.g., a history of dealing with difference or motivation in school). An  Outcomes with a Public Face  61 additional bar graph grouped the 22 Asset questions into four major catego­ ries (relations with adults; agency and responsibility; attitudes and motiva­ tion, planning and decision-making, and dealing with others), letting each  Scholar and each school compare their level of Assets with their cohort.4 3.	 Most revealing, a pie chart showing what percent of the student’s  pre- and post-statements fell into each of the four levels of reflective  decision-making 4.	 And finally, a simple bar graph that let Scholars compare their own score  to what they could achieve if all their comments were a Reasoned Reflec­ tive choice. We then compiled the results into a second small booklet for each Scholar and  a more general one for each school with an explanation of the project which we  distributed via print, PDF, and website in order to reach out to parents, teachers,  and counselors. The booklet even appeared at some of the schools’ annual exhibit  events. Both the analysis and documents were cheap to make and easy to circu­ late (Appendix 3.2). The significance of circulation coupled with these somewhat  formal results was clearly evident in the case of a Scholar, Jonathan. A high-per­ forming student on the autism spectrum, he had been supported (and smoth­ ered, it seemed) by wealthy parents. Coming to campus on his own (without his  aide) was a new experience in independence that gave him an enlarged sense of  agency. Jonathan’s parents were not going to allow him to move away for college  (even though his preferred college could accommodate his disabilities). But as his  school counselor told us, Jonathan’s newfound sense of himself, combined with  the formal evidence from the Decision Makers project, persuaded his parents to  change their minds. Thus, this talented young person could now pursue his cho­ sen path toward college and independence. The Power of Interpretation Another important, but less visible, rewarding outcome for the Scholars was the  practice of interpreting the scoring—themselves. Coming back to campus to review  their Profile results, we initially began by working as a group to score and discuss a  sample of high- and low-scoring results from a previous project. But as we probed  the differences, the teenagers began to explore and compare possible options, see  new possibilities, and draw out the reasoning behind both good and bad choices.  They then used this experience to interpret their own comments and scores. This  collaborative analysis created a fascinating platform for interpretive action where  Scholars could articulate their own goals and strategies as part of a socially shared  inquiry. (I would add, their unexpected explanations and reasoning also influenced  the interpretive frames of all of us, including the teachers, at the table.) 4.	  The set of Search Institute Assets we selected for this evaluation were ones a student  could choose to acquire. 62   Chapter 3 This set of interpretive outcomes was discovered rather than planned for. Al­ though we had prepared some questions based on the initial scores, what mat­ tered was how the students read these responses rather than how the institution  scored them. After that, these roundtable talks held after each project became an  educational invitation to interpretation, inquiry, and planning. For example, the  eighth Asset Assessment question in the Starting Point Profile had asked students  to rate themselves on a scale of 1–5 on this statement: “In conversations with  adults, I can communicate my goals and my strengths in ways that they can un­ derstand.” In one not atypical case, both schools in this cohort gave themselves  low scores on this Asset question: 2.2 and 2.4 out of 5. It sparked an animated  analysis of what those numbers really meant, starting with our question: “What  does it mean to communicate goals and strengths with authority? Exactly how  do you do that?” Everyone was seeing and naming new possibilities. Eventually,  those questions lead to others: “So why are both groups low on communication  strategies?” But for the teachers, perhaps the most instructive result was insight  these upperclassmen had into the question: “What strategies do younger tenth  graders actually use?” I would say, the outcome that may matter most here is not  the particular answers, though often surprising, but the shared, self-conscious  reflective thought this opportunity stimulated. The scoring of Asset Question 19 raised an issue which often comes up for  students with learning disabilities. “When I enter unfamiliar situations (where  people have new expectations of me or confusing ways of explaining things), I  am good at finding out all the things I need to know.” It had received a low score  of 2.7 and 2.2 from two high schools. We asked the teens: “Why is that? So how  could you make that a strength? Anybody got good strategies?” Our request to  interpret this data shifted authority to where the real interpretive expertise lay:  with the students. It turned the limits of a written and scored assessment into a  powerful tool for metacognitive work and shared learning. So the really fruitful discussion began when the Scholars began interpretat­ ing and scoring responses to the written section of the Profile and its questions,  such as, “What I am working on in my life?” and, “What are my goals and plans  for achieving them?” Many Starting Point Profiles had relied on Level 1 common  sense statements such as: I would like to make friends in my neighborhood. I want to go to college. But, we asked the group, how would you evaluate the following statement (drawn  from previous Profiles)? I want to do better in school, because I know that if I keep get­ ting bad grades, I won’t be able to get into college. You have to  work hard to get ahead in life. Outcomes with a Public Face  63 As the discussion drew out, key terms (here in bold) became cues as to why this  statement works at a Level 2: it provides reasons and specifics, such as examples  or steps, that make it a plan that could support action. Students saw the relevance  to plans like the one below, which dealt with the everyday realities of a crowded  household. I am going to study every day after school at my desk in my  room, with the radio turned off and my brothers and sisters  not allowed to come in and bother me. Discussing the final example below served an additional purpose of letting stu­ dents articulate just what it was that made this example into a more-fully packed  Level 3. As we saw for the college students in Chapter 2, Case 2, being able to  name and explain your intuitions and insights can make them both operational  and open to reflection. I could get a job doing fast food. On the other hand, [Rivals]  that kind of job doesn’t pay much money. Doing something,  even volunteering, with computers might not pay a lot either,  [Consequences] but it might lead me to a job that makes a lot of  money and would look good on my resume [Reasons]. Using the additional criteria that can support Reflective Action, the group  then began to imagine possible Conditions, noticing how the words “if . . . then”  could open up an inquiry into what those Conditions might be. The criteria of  Reflection also turned up questions such as, “Is there a pattern in how I choose  jobs?” Interpreting these scores went beyond text-based analysis, as it let students  talk about why they made the choices they made, and led them to articulate the  conditions and qualifications that affect their choices. I have to start asking my teachers for help at school when I’m  having a problem. Before, I thought that asking my teachers  would make me look stupid because my dad always hates it  when I ask him questions. But now I know teachers are really  there to help me. This statement reveals the student’s knowledge that even good decisions will meet  roadblocks. The next statement shows a similar awareness, plus the willingness to  take an experimental stance to a problem. One change I would like to make is to be more giving to my par­ ents. But my parents aren’t always good to me and maybe that’s  why I’m not always nice to them, but I’m still going to be nice  to them and if I do that maybe they’ll learn from my example. The responses also brought issues in the social environments of schools up for  64   Chapter 3 discussion, leading to questions such as, why did this school score differently  from mine? To sum up, a fairly simple statistical analysis let us showcase the achieve­ ment of these students in a meaningful, accessible, and visually inviting way to  a diverse community. At the same time, it created an opportunity to critically  interpret an assessment and its scores in a way that privileged their insider  knowledge, created new insights, offered exposure to rival readings and the  recognition of a personal application. In the open-endedness of this interpre­ tive analysis, the students were teaching themselves those reflective moves— what they could mean, how to recognize them, and the words that helped you  try one out. Later in the project, another outcome emerged. We had been noticing  something unusual about the Scholars’ personally focused writing on campus  and its contrast to that at the neighborhood-based CLC, with its issue-centered  work done in an inner-city social atmosphere on the writers’ home turf. We  were somewhat surprised to find how quickly the Decision Maker Scholars on  campus were disposed to disclose (and write about) serious, personal dilem­ mas, from issues of gender identity to projected “unavoidable” fights with family  members, peers, and teachers. (Sometimes these dilemmas precipitated small  group discussions around the computer, which actually reinterpreted the “un­ avoidable” into better options.) We suspect that the Scholars’ openness to rais­ ing and writing about such sensitive topics with their Mentors stemmed in part  from Decision Makers’ on-campus, computer-supported, one-on-one design,  as well as its specific focus on personal decisions. By contrast, the atmosphere at  the CLC and its focus on public issues tended to be much more teen-dominated  and community-based. Perhaps the privacy of on-campus writing, combined  with the Decision Makers’ increased focus on quiet personal agency, primed  the Scholars to put their deepest, most pressing dilemmas forward for analysis.  At the same time, it was probably at the expense of an invigorated sense of a  public voice and agency. Finally, in my judgment, the consistently most-significant outcome of the en­ tire Decision Makers project has been the transformation of students’ percep­ tions of themselves as indeed decision makers in their own lives, often in ways  they hadn’t acknowledged before. Whether a decision was for good or for ill, a  recognition of your agency brings with it a sense of responsibility—and often a  change in the perception others have of you. By tracking participants’ perfor­ mance in statistical, graphic ways, we can give persuasive visibility to internal  strengths and growth. And at the same time, the scoring may play an even more  important role when it is interpreted by the writers themselves in a social context  that supports articulation in the midst of rivals, reasons, and options from your  peers. This less visible outcome is likely to be a new level of metacognitive aware­ ness and knowing. Outcomes with a Public Face  65 Appendix 3.1. Sketch of the Starting  and Check Point Profiles This overview of the Profiles shows its structure and key questions. The Starting Point Profile This computer questionnaire asked students to create four Snapshots  of themselves, typing each reply in small, expanding boxes to encour­ age a focused response. Snapshot 1. Who is Traveling with  Me? (Network of Support) The Profile asked for a brief written response: “Who are the key people  you see as a part of your personal network and a reason they matter?” Snapshot 2. What Am I Working on in My Life Right Now? 1.	 In learning and education 2.	 In personal & community relationships 3.	 In making, budgeting, and using money 4.	 In personal time and recreation 5.	 In physical, emotional, and sexual health Under each of these five topics there were three expandable boxes  asking for a short, written response addressing: “What matters to me  in this area? What values or goals or problems am I working on in my  life?” And then: “What specific steps am I taking to reach my goals or  act on what I care about?” How they articulated their answers showed  both their goals and concerns and the level of awareness and control  visible in their response. These written responses would be the basis for  coding their level of reflective decision making. Snapshot 3. What is My Situation? Based on research into markers for healthy personal development in  adolescents by the Search Institute (https://searchinstitute.org/), this  Snapshot asked students to rate the level of their “personal assets” from  1 to 4, in response to 22 options such as, “I am connected to a church  or club where a young person can play a useful role in their communi­ ty,” or “I have a history of handling negative peer pressure, especially in  difficult situations.” 66   Chapter 3 Snapshot 4. A Letter to Myself Finally, the Starting Point Profile is rounded out with some forward-think­ ing questions, asking the writer to name a change they would like to  make in three areas: 1) my network of support; 2) my goals or values;  and 3) in building two personal assets.” The challenge comes when  they are asked to make their decision-making operational by using the  two response boxes to describe: “1) Some steps I think I can take to  make that change are . . . and 2) I’ll know when I am starting to make  progress when . . .” Again, the format of two specific boxes for each  topic was designed to call for specific answers. To be upfront about the critical criteria for good decision-making,  the Starting and Check Point Profile pages offered a sidebar reminder  of moves we had worked with. Tip: A reasoned, reflective decision includes √  Specific details √  Reasons (because . . .) √  Rivals (someone might say . . .) √  Roadblocks or qualifications (but, maybe, might . . .) √  Conditions (if . . . then . . .) The Check Point Profile The Check Point starts by inviting an updated Network of Support.  Then, to motivate a discussion of some of the same questions asked in  the Starting Point, it sketches a scenario that asks: Imagine that you are about to have a job interview  with a new Supervisor. He or she has read your re­ sume, but what they are really thinking is: •  Is this person going to be a good member of  my team? •  Can she take responsibility? Can he make  good decisions? •  So how can you show that Supervisor what  you can do? The Profile then asks them to respond to the question by thinking of  a time they had to make a decision and to then: 1.	 Describe the problem and the Story-Behind-the-Story. 2.	 Describe how you made the decision: your options, rivals, and  outcomes. 3.	 Now tell what it shows about YOU! Outcomes with a Public Face  67 Appendix 3.2. Asset Analysis Included  in the Scholar’s Journey Book The Scholars’ individual Journey Book included pre- and post-graphs from the  Asset Analysis, plus pie charts based on the Scholar’s decision-making statements.  The Asset graph below is an example of an aggregated display of the five groups  of assets made for each school who participated. These visual displays stimulated  discussion for the Scholars and increased the impact for adult readers. Figure 3.1. Level of assets. The two pie charts below show the proportion of each type of statement this  student was making in their pre-test at the beginning of the program and then six  months later. The following reminder box was in the margin of the Profile they  were creating. Remember, a reasoned, reflective decision includes  Specific details  Reasons (because…)  Rivals (someone might say…)  Roadblocks (but, since, if…then)  Reflections on your choices Figures 3.2 and 3.3 show pre- and post-test changes in growth of reflective  decision making. 68   Chapter 3 Figure 3.2.

Rather  they reflect these writers’ awareness of and ability to use powerful new strategies  in a context that called for them.  69 Chapter 4. Interrogating Hidden  Frames as a Path to Change As I said, this moment does not mark some decisive victory in gay  rights—but it does within my sphere. It is a victory that I helped create  within the sphere in which I have power to make a change. – Justine The Problem: Interpretative Frames at Work Social engagement is a powerful teacher that broadens the scope of learning to  the way ideas, contexts, other people with their differing traditions, values and  goals, interact.1 It creates that “expansive learning” Yrjö Engeström has described  in which more elements of an entire activity system, as well as its conflicts and  contradictions, are recognized (Introduction). However, insight needs to pierce  the veil in two directions by recognizing not only what is “out there” but also our  own silent interpretive process—the assumptions, constructions, omissions— which we bring to creating our own “knowing.” And it is engagement with other  realities that provides the pushback to let us see what our own internal voices are  saying. So this chapter will look at a way writing conjoined with engagement can  let us probe and respond to those hidden interpretive frames. The agenda in education, one that is giving critical, social, and local engage­ ment a visible place in our pedagogy, is calling for a demanding form of praxis as  Paulo Freire sees it—a cycle of action and reflection in which theory and practice  interact. It is also an intersectional agenda trying to recognize forces that are de­ scribed so differently in rhetoric and composition, cultural studies, communica­ tion, policy, and social movement work. And in this broad interactive space, writ­ ing, as Linda Adler-Kassner, Robert Crooks, and Ann Watters put it, “is so much  more, . . . [a] strategy that can be used for learning, a way of negotiating identities  within and around specific contexts, a representation of ideas, a way of participat­ ing in ideologies, a strategy for movement” (“Service-Learning” 318). That may  seem like a lot to ask, especially of assigned written work in a college course. The  questions here are, “How might socially engaged courses support such a strategic  rhetorical art?” and “How can (can?) writing, in particular, create that space in  which identity, ideology, and social interaction actually shape one another?” 1.

Reprinted with permission. 70   Chapter 4 Our interdisciplinary visions of engagement often vary in their focus, wheth­ er it is on ideology, partnerships, rhetorical agency, or social action. However, for  writers, one of the critical forces to be reckoned with is the role (for good and for  ill) of the interpretive frames we bring to our work. Interpretive frames (as they  are described in communication, policy, and psychological studies) are rhetori­ cal, presentational devices constructed to selectively emphasize or hide features  of an issue.2 They let us make quick sense of things, prompting us, for instance, to  make snap judgments about the intelligence of students based on their linguistic  fluency, or style of arguing, or simply their control of academic discourse (Hull).  As social constructs, interpretive frames such as those circulating through our  reading and writing can provide a logic that scripts the exercise of power and  exclusion. Writing, as a tool for social engagement in education, is often used to  critique and challenge the frames that exclude and silence the voices of others.  This chapter is about just such interpretive frames—when these frames are our  own. And how writing—in the form of theory-guided metacognitive analysis— can be an actionable force for change for our students (and ourselves). After ex­ ploring some of the options for dealing with these frames, I want to focus on how  students in a publicly engaged course translated insight into actions. Dealing with Cultural Frames The interrogating gaze of critical discourse has taught us to recognize those whis­ pered voices of culturally created “common sense” and how they shape the social  messages buried in our texts, arguments, assumptions, and interpretations. Ide­ ology, one name we give to this amorphous force, supplies us with its “invested  patterns of ideas that explain and justify society as it is [which in turn] estab­ lishes belief” (Dana Cloud 57). In response, cultural criticism has given us new  2.	  In argument theory, the term “framing” typically refers to a context created to present  the problem in a certain light (Benford and Snow). In policy studies, frames are even more  action-oriented, providing a “normative-prescriptive story that sets out a problematic policy  problem and a course of action to be taken” (Rein and Schoen, qtd. in Fischer 144). As a  real workhorse in the face of conflicting frames that socially construct the problem situa­ tion, they provide “conceptual coherence, a direction for action, a basis for persuasion and  a framework for the collections and analysis of data—order, action, rhetoric and analysis”  (Rein and Schoen, qtd. in Fischer 144). In Erving Goffman’s sociological account, they go  even further to re/frame or rekey a situation to transform what people think is going on in a  strip of discourse (8). In psychology, the related notion of schema describes an individual’s  partially shared mental network of ideas, images, etc., that are learned over time rather than  preconstructed (Anderson). In rhetoric, “rhetorical archetypes” such as the Gay Warrior  archetype Doug Cloud has documented in military controversies, work as “repetitive, pro­ totypical representations of identity categories that circulate widely and are used to support  arguments—the ‘stock characters’ of rhetorical discourse” (“The Rise” 29). These variations  highlight the variety of ways frames can be created and/or used. Interrogating Hidden Frames as a Path to Change   71 conceptual tools to uncover ideology’s presence and oppressive effects enacted  through interpretive frames. But a new take on what is missing from such critique comes from Dana  Cloud, a self-described socialist, critical rhetorical scholar of political discourse,  and practicing working-class activist. She has been a card-carrying member of  what she calls “the Culture of Critical Discourse,” or CCD. However, her recent  work in Reality Bites marks a re-orientation to wider public change that this crit­ ical discourse, she argues, has still failed to enact. One problem is that the tactics  of CCD she describes simply can’t compete with social doxa—received common  sense—as a force for social change. Moreover, this rational, analytical “perspec­ tive from which to perform criticism in the service of demystifying power” is  itself an elite discourse, addressed to the already-persuaded (5). And most im­ portantly, she argues, it fails to recognize, much less draw upon or value, the  perspectives of the people marginalized or oppressed by dominant paradigms.  CCD fails to represent the knowledge and stories of marginalized voices as voices  rather than the topic of its critical analysis. And secondly, its rationalized rhetoric  of critique simply lacks the power to compel change. Within rhetoric and composition, one strong response to this problem of rep­ resentation has been to draw out, prize, and publish the unacknowledged knowl­ edge created in the experience of community partnerships (Goldblatt), commu­ nity publishing (Parks, “Strategic”)  , urban teenagers (Flower, “Community Lit”),  neighborhood adults (Rousculp), streetwise news writers (Mathieu), nursing  aids (Flower, “Negotiating”), Native American storytellers (Cushman), Chicago  street gangs (Cintron), community “instructors” (Shah), gay high school teachers  (Clifton), or refugees (Long), to name a few. For the college students embedded  in such projects, their own intellectual, intercultural, and sociopolitical develop­ ment is also extended by writing. Within academic criticism, the related approach Dana Cloud proposes is to  refocus that “Culture of Critical Discourse” less on the markers of oppressive ide­ ology (as we, of course, perceive them) and more on what is missing, what we  overlook: the voices and experience of those people most subjected to the opera­ tions of such ideology. To do so would mean first identifying the interpretive frames that are in play  in, say, discussions of immigrants, welfare recipients, or first-generation students.  These widely received ideological frames mediate our perception in the shape of  “invisible naturalized common sense associated with a dominant group’s interest”  (Dana Cloud 63, emphasis added). Like the more specific constructs or men­ tal schemas studied in psychological research, they are essentially “strategies for  handling social truths through filtering for salience and emphasis” (61). That is,  they tell us to hone in on what is both relevant (in the context they invoke) and  important (from their perspective). Using interpretive frames is a normal psycho­ logical process. However, not all frames have the same ethical standing when they  select for what matters, as when, for instance, they frame immigrants as a wave  72   Chapter 4 or hoard of uneducated and illegal border crossers seeking to suck up our taxes  and live off welfare (although, ironically, they are also assumed to be stealing our  jobs). With the help of a corporately controlled media, such interpretive frames,  which also tend to serve various political and financial interests, become turned  into doxa—into common sense. What Cloud calls for is not simply exposing or naming the pieces of such in­ terpretive frames but, rather, asking: what is left out or covered up; whose voices  are ignored or silenced; and what are the lived experiences, the values, the goals  of those guest workers, asylum-seekers, and (daring or desperate) border cross­ ers? In contrast to liberals’ current obsession with the rhetoric of “fact-checking,”  Cloud calls for two alternative practices. The first is what she calls “frame-check­ ing,” which asks, “Whose knowledge is it? Who is it by and who is it for? Who is left  out?” (136). Secondly, the goal here is not just “to perform criticism in the service  of demystifying power” but also to create “an oppositional ‘reality-based’ com­ munity that can ‘bite back’” (8). She calls, that is, for a form of “rhetorical realism”  that can direct and incite action. Dana Cloud’s explicit call for an altered stance to social justice would revise both  the academic discourse of critique and the public, political rhetoric of “fact-check­ ing” by drawing instead on the powerful rhetoric of what she calls the “Big Five”  strategies: Narrative, Myth, Embodiment, Affect, and Spectacle. Although all these  are often associated with effectively deceptive manipulation (as most any rhetorical  strategy can be), the ethical test Cloud proposes is their “fidelity or faithfulness . . .  to the interests and goals of the people being addressed by and constituted in them”  (161). In other words, the Big Five strategies are ethical to the extent that the voices/ concerns/interests of the marginalized are accurately represented. Cloud, then, maps  out an important path to social change based on stimulating mass social movement  with tools that can scale up circulation in all sorts of mass media. This publicly performative perspective, however, raises a real challenge for  justice-oriented rhetoric and writing teachers: how do you translate the concep­ tual analysis of a problematic practice into action and change? Moreover, what  do you do when a given practice may be marginalizing others without anyone’s  real intent to do so? In particular, what do we do when that frame or practice is  unconsciously our own? Like Cloud, this chapter seeks ways to deal with these un­ interrogated frames that mediate everyday interpretation. But it chooses to work  at the other, individual end of the spectrum, where teachers not only probe our  own frames but, in this case, help students do the same. To see what this individ­ ualized path does and doesn’t offer, I want to put it briefly in context of other con­ temporary choices by asking: who or what is being diminished by these frames,  to whom is this argument addressed, and what sort of rhetorical response, using  what discourse, is being proposed? Dana Cloud, for instance, has studied the way whistleblowers have been  framed, to different effects, as heroes, traitors, or queer; or how Planned Parent­ hood providers are represented by the competing frames of feminism, medical  Interrogating Hidden Frames as a Path to Change   73 care, legalism, and religious dogmatism. Cloud is speaking to colleagues and ac­ tivists in the language of cultural theory, but she is calling progressives to turn the  Discourse of Cultural Critique and fact-checking into a much more persuasive  rhetoric. Designed for the unpersuaded general public, her approach is working  subversively, you might say, to draw them into thinking with a new interpretive  frame. We are her allies, just in need of a better discourse tool. A concrete instance of what this means turns up in disability studies, in which  the frame of normalcy “marks disabled people as ‘different’ yet simultaneously  demands conformity to social and material environments designed primarily for  and by ‘normal’ bodies” (Glavin, Rhetoric). What Mary Glavan’s grounded work  with actual families goes on to show is that the normalcy frame conceals the  rhetorical labor through which both “normal” and “difference” are constructed  and perceived. That is, “the emergent, iterative, risk-ridden rhetorical labor of un­ derstanding and representing oneself in contested spaces…. where representing  a “normal” self is also an agentive act, similarly shaped by networks of individual  and structural relationships” (Reframing). Dealing with Identity Frames Uninterrogated frames may also be working closer to home. For instance, college  can be a place where students can discover who they are or develop a fresh iden­ tity. It also opens its closet to a set of well-defined roles complete with all its de­ fining garments you are asked to step into. Though once you don its hat and boots  you will feel the pressure to keep them on. Identity frames that dictate choices  and actions may be surprisingly insidious. A rural Appalachian student comes up  to a high profile competitive urban university and the identity package (hillbilly,  redneck, backwards (or underprepared, first generation in academic lingo)) is  waiting at their dorm door. If you can’t fit into a new costume (i.e., walk, talk, act  like a prospective engineer, computer scientist, or even a historian or professional  designer) your capabilities, intelligence and even value as a potential class team  member will be devalued. And with this suddenly diminished sense of power,  you might even buy into some of that assessment yourself. Amanda Tennant’s long-term study of this expectation showed, however, that  some students place a high value on their Appalachian identity, with its deeply  held values for family and loyalty in a working-class community—an identity  they don’t want to give up (“Rhetorical College Experience”). But holding onto  that old identity frame would come at a cost. In the studies Tennant reviews, pow­ er among marginalized communities is often theorized as the ability to navigate  the conflicting pressures to pass as members of the dominant, succeed academ­ ically, fit in and be accepted socially, while on the other hand, to maintain and  honor connections to their backgrounds or group, and critique and resist their  marginalization. Yet these pressures are frequently at odd with one another; when  one type of power is gained, another is lost. 74   Chapter 4 In this case the identity some students brought with them did not actually stay  hidden. However, they crafted a remarkable alternative way to gain power with  what Tennant calls rhetorical (in)visibility. That is, they undertook the first step  of strategic self-reflection to discover which markers were “tellable” in public dis­ course (“mountaineer talk” is fine) and which (your firearms and “cricks”) were  not. Taking the next step, to weigh the risk and rewards of these markers in terms  of power, allowed them to turn (in)visibility into a strategic rhetorical choice. For  instance, students found they could carefully distance themselves from the “un­ tellable” even as they maintained connections to home. Or they would transform  Appalachian identity into a marker of diversity. In their writing they learned to  draw on the rhetorical power of experiential knowledge, but do so in ways that  that readers would not recognize it as an “Appalachian” experience (681). Here is  a case where self-reflection let students rise to a conscious awareness of the po­ tential for power tied each of these identify frames. And by crafting an effective  rhetorical strategy, to avoid being co-opted by either one. Nine years later when Tenant returned to interview these graduates, she  found they were still quite aware of their strategies for rhetorical (in)visibility and  even critical of some of their older ones. However, two who had already achieved  well-paying jobs on the West Coast, had moved back home to Appalachia, by  choice! Ben has translated what is called the Appalachian black hole (escape) nar­ rative into a new frame: the pressure to return home driven by family and values.  Their old college friends, who couldn’t understand why, kept pressuring them  to “get the heck out of there” and go where the money was. But these graduates’  reasons speak to the direct rejection of a frame they knew so well: the objective  of a college education is to gain wealth and status, that is, get out of Appalachia,  abandon that identity, and make money. As Tennant puts it, “Ben resists the as­ sumption that he has failed to live up the expectations for exceptional Appala­ chians who escape their home region to achieve success and wealth on the West  Coast.” Instead, Ben and April have come to “frame a narrative of success in terms  of place” and its ability to foster “experiential knowledge, [defined as] exposure  to the natural world and strong family connections” (Rhetorical Cultural Experi­ ence). This has become an inspiring study of “reframing.” Unfortunately, some identity frames, such as the role of being a social advo­ cate, come with an almost obligatory script: taking an assertive, even aggressive  personal and rhetorical stance may seem a given. People become advocates for a  cause because they care or are even passionate about making change. And when  the issue involves race or sex or cultural identity they may do so because their  own personhood is at stake. As a frame, advocacy dictates both one’s role and  rhetorical stance—and writers typically expect or demand that readers take their  trademark stance. But in Arguing Identity and Human Rights, Doug Cloud opens a new and  powerful path as he explores the presence, benefits, and limitations that alter­ native often competing models of argument and advocacy can give us. What are  Interrogating Hidden Frames as a Path to Change   75 the tradeoffs of downplaying versus asserting difference or agency, of responding  to clichés or asserting a theoretical stance? Building on his subtitle, Among Rival  Options, this scholarly exploration is uniquely engaging because it is about choice,  including his own history. For example, in the 1980s Larry Kramer (founder of  ACT UP) went after not only the homophobes and government institutions ig­ noring AIDS, but gay college students themselves (“queer kids”) like Cloud. Stri­ dently arguing they weren’t “angry enough” Kramer told them that a cool, calm,  rational tone (that universal standard of good communication) was no more than  a capitulation to white supremacy. Advocacy was attack, and writers should use  their own discomfort in order to forcibly create it in others. Looking back, Cloud  sees that rival options were not in this identity guide. It’s easy to see how a young person could read his words and,  without a competing narrative, come to think that good activ­ ists are angry activists. But I don’t want to be an angry activist.  I’ve already done that, and although it was completely appro­ priate to my situation at the time, it took a terrible toll on me.  Today, I choose to go a different way, though the actual choice  has unfolded over years. (142) The issue here is choice and how identity frames not only silently interpret  your appropriate role, but close down some powerful options. For me, a problem-solving state is much more effective. I do  my best work when I focus on the options at hand and their  probable outcomes, rather than dwell on the moral urgency of  combatting White supremacy, of which I am already convinced.  This mindset pushes me beyond discomfort, and helps me ask  action-oriented questions like these. . . . (144) This inquiry into choice can be one of the most powerful strategies a rhetori­ cian has. Dealing with Educational Frames By contrast, a recent statement from the Conference on College Composition  and Communication (CCCC) issues a proclamation, explicitly focused on rac­ ism, addressed to academics not as fellow activists but as the locus of the prob­ lem. Its very title, “This Ain’t Another Statement! This is a DEMAND for Black  Linguistic Justice,” challenges the assumption that the white, socially constructed  norms of “academic language” and “standard English” are desirable standard and  demands “widespread systemic change” in our curricula, our discourse, and our  commitments as teachers (2020). A direct descendent of the rhetoric of Black  Lives Matter and the anti-Black violence movement, it takes its forcefully asser­ tive style into the quiescent space of our classrooms and journals. Disinterested  76   Chapter 4 in our good intentions or history of merely principled, supportive “statements,” it  demands a change in practice. Positioning white readers as the outsiders, speak­ ing, you might say, more “at” than “to” a white us, it jars us into consciousness.  The effect of this shift from Doug Cloud’s collegial, doable argument to one clear­ ly implicating the reader in the problem has a parallel described in James Cone’s  classic Martin & Malcolm & America: A Dream or a Nightmare. As he sees it, the  shockingly radical demands of Malcolm X made previously resistant people turn  to Martin Luther King as a welcome model of moderation. As part of the contemporary academic discussion of racism, this DEMAND  is an institutionally embedded statement. In choosing to take an adversarial rhe­ torical style with its own National Council of Teachers of English constituency, it  throws some of the other options in this conversation into relief. One could, for  instance, choose to theorize anti-racism in broad generalities, urging us to cri­ tique our own “humanist” assumptions (Boyle). Other approaches describe ways  it turns up in language (Bosmajian; Villanueva) or uncover forms of microaggres­ sion or color-blind racism (Bonilla-Silva). Whether the focus is on our own or  public frames, what unites these approaches is their focus on race. Another set of discourses, more clearly focused on educational frames, speak  directly to teachers and theorists, addressing them as colleagues and people of  good will—who are often trapped in the doxa of education and its unexamined,  marginalizing frames. These contemporary voices may draw on Paulo Freire or  Antonio Gramsci, but they locate the problem right in our own classroom prac­ tice. In AntiRacist Writing Assessment Ecologies, Asao Inoue argues that we are  “missing important opportunities to interrogate the dominant discourse as nor­ mative or interrogating the hegemonic ways of evaluating texts in classrooms”  (19). If we talk about the rhetorical demands of a text with the stock phrases of  evaluation (e.g., unity, details, development, and organization), “how will [stu­ dents] negotiate the ways that any ‘text is evaluated’ against a dominant white  discourse?” (19). However, in place of direct classroom interrogation of that form  of hegemony, he asserts that the problem is assessment itself. Inoue sees his larger social/political purpose as challenging “White habitus  reinforced,” as he says, “by other discourses of empiricism: objectivity, neutrality,  hyper individualism, unsentimental, detached discussion, and a Cartesian Cogi­ to” (112). But in his own highly diverse classes of students who have had those  dominant (racist) criteria used to dismiss and devalue them as writers, his re­ sponse is to replace the standard processes of evaluating writing with student  dialogues in which the class itself negotiates and develops the criteria for an ef­ fectual text. Individual grades, then, are based primarily on measurements of the  “labor” the writer puts into developing, discussing, and creating that text. This  response is designed to make those (often internalized) frames that define one’s  identity as a writer simply irrelevant. And the measure of success is seeing stu­ dents reflect on the remarkable discovery that they had choice within rubrics,  such as organization, and that disagreement was acceptable (e.g., did the thesis  Interrogating Hidden Frames as a Path to Change   77 really have to be up front, and apparently you could use “I”). And in some cases,  this new confidence even translated into the motivation to learn some of those  “standard” features. Like Inoue, I wanted the students in my publicly engaged courses described in  previous chapters to question the interpretative frames they use to evaluate their  writing and to engage with others. In Inoue’s case, the competing frames students  needed to recognize were those of upper level “theme writing” and a formal­ ly “well-developed essay.” However, in my community-engaged courses, success  was more likely to depend on rhetorical invention, demanding both discovery  and change. And the assessment frame in the headlights here was application:  are you able to apply your learning to a new rhetorical situation, to take it beyond  theory or generalized concepts into situated practice? Using the Lens of Frame Analysis A final new educational alternative to consider would not just critique frames but  change them. Rather than focus on a given problematic frame used by others,  such as “Standard English,” it would put the frame in context, in an expanded  universe—in an ecological frame. The metaphor of rhetorical ecologies, as Na­ thaniel Rivers and Ryan Weber use it, replaces the tidy image of a communica­ tion triangle with an expanded rhetorical universe of social action through public  rhetoric. Using the Montgomery Bus Boycott, they model an ecological analysis  that translates this rhetorical situation into a dynamic, intensely networked rhe­ torical and material landscape. Their analysis turns a short story of Rosa Parks’  courageous action and Martin Luther King’s leadership into a fully staged drama  sustained by a “diverse environment of mundane, concatenated texts and count­ er-rhetorics,” which includes not only letters and speeches but “newsletters, inter­ nal memos, proposals, strategy documents, images of protests and the spaces . . .  that shaped and were shaped by rhetorical activity” (196-97). Without the energy  that circulated through this network, the Bus Boycott’s 381-day joint effort would  never have been sustained. When students take this ecological orientation in a  public rhetoric class project, it becomes a tool that transforms their “background”  research—giving it “an expanded scope that views rhetorical action as emergent  and enacted through a complex ecology of texts, writers, readers, institutions,  objects and history” (188). Like Dana Cloud’s frame checking, it zooms out, em­ bedding us in a larger cast of characters. This brief review of approaches to the work and the danger of frames suggests  the rich diversity of our field’s own interpretative frames for dealing with repre­ sentations that marginalize others. And because the success of substantive social  change (i.e., not just political reorganization) is never complete and rarely stable, I  believe we need to work on multiple fronts and down all the paths we can muster.  This study of hidden frames will describe yet another way to instantiate change,  though not only a public voice but also by supporting individual, self-conscious  78   Chapter 4 action in everyday social interactions with family, colleagues, a classroom or  community. The goal of this alternative rhetoric was to help students create a  local path to action, starting with a theory-guided investigation of frames at work  in their own, often-unquestioned practice. In doing so, students soon began to  notice the previously undetected consequences of their actions at work within  the ecology of a family, an institution, a class, within policy documents and class  plans, in subsequent lectures, formal meetings, and uneasy conversations with  peers, as well as in some unanticipated effects on a wide body of students. Finally, frame analysis can be turned into a detailed yet coherent way to pres­ ent what Alex Helberg calls a “contextually aware strategic communication plan.”  His study of two ideologically and locally competing food donating programs— one doing their civic duty to combat waste, the other with an anarchist agenda to  combat poverty based on political capitalism. To help activists understand what  they are facing, he created a brief guide for “How to Frame a Complex Systemic  Issue.” Designed as a table, it names three key moves we can make to develop a  coherent set of problem/solution framing strategies, a set of conceptual metaphors  to help simplify the complexity of the issue, and a coherent and discrete set of  identities & roles for your prospective participants. In the Guide each frame is  explored with Generative Questions and Examples, such as “Who has the ability  to take action on behalf of this issue?” and What are their “identity markers?”  The examples allow a close comparison of the stance of the (well-off) citizen  “Food Rescue Heroes” to that of the Food Not Bombs anarchist group dedicated  to “fighting the greed and power” of institutions and business. His use of a da­ ta-based frame analysis created an insightful guide to dealing with a complex,  politically charged situation with a strategic community plan. The Metacognitive Path: From Analysis to Reflection  to Actionable Critical Consciousness Like the critical and rhetorical approaches noted earlier, social movement stud­ ies map a road to action, with a difference. In Robert D. Benford and David A.  Snow’s extraordinary review of that research, what really matters is the transfor­ mation and use of interpretive frames. In this action-oriented context, frames are  not merely the hidden perpetrators of exclusion scripted by interest and power;  they are the rhetorical engine driving social action. Frames interpret the “world  out there” (such as the detention of illegal immigrants, or alternatively, of asylum  seekers) in order to “render events or occurrences meaningful” (614). More to the  point, they are not given but must be constructed to work as what Benford and  Snow call “collective action frames” (611). Here, “framing” is a verb that “denotes  an active, processual phenomenon that implies agency and contention at the level  of reality construction” (614). As Frank Fischer’s useful work in Reframing Public  Policy demonstrates, framing (and/or “reframing”) some “reality” can not only  challenge existing ways of making sense of things but do the cognitive work of  Interrogating Hidden Frames as a Path to Change   79 supplying us not only with a problem definition and diagnosis of the cause, but a  map for action, and the grounds for persuasion (144). I raise this positive perspective on how frames can work to put our metacog­ nitive path in perspective. We could read Dana Cloud and Benford and Snow  as each sketching two necessary but different paths to change. Cloud’s Culture  of Critical Discourse produces a language of critique designed to reveal power  and promote awareness and critical consciousness. Her expansion of this dis­ course would enlarge its agenda to include marginalized voices and invent a  more aggressive (and effective) rhetoric to put this critique into wide circula­ tion. Benford and Snow’s social movement agenda, on the other hand, comes to  life in the highly interactive, constructive context of creating and transforming  frames. Their desired outcome is a motivating “collective action” frame. The work  of metacognitive inquiry described here lies somewhere between critique and  collective action. Its path is routed through an analysis of the (typically unexam­ ined) exclusionary interpretive frames operating within our own experience. The  outcome, when initiated in an educational setting, can be a negotiated one that  recognizes conflicted and missing knowledge, a probing discussion with others,  or the foundation for a working theory that attempts to transform that frame into  a more inclusive practice. From my particular perspective, in problem-solving cognition and actionable  rhetoric as well as community writing, the problem looks like this: how do we,  each of us, open up a live circuit that leads from critique to the grounded, inter­ nal, cognitive work of interpretation that guides our sometimes-unconsidered  responses to problematic situations? This is the site of situated cognition, the place  where ideas are operationalized in interactions with others. It is at this dynamic  intersection of experience and metacognitive inquiry that we can see a path, not  just to changing others but also ourselves—and to helping students likewise carry  out their own education for engagement. The actionable critical consciousness in the cases sketched below can be trig­ gered by ordinary experience when reality does indeed “bite,” when it directly  challenges a familiar interpretive frame and pushes us to a metacognitive aware­ ness of the friction between expectation and experience. That friction can push us  to thinking about our own thinking when, for instance, we suddenly realize that  what we perceived as a student’s “natural” accidental “slip” into “ungrammatical”  Black English was, in fact, not only intentional but was a precise and effective lin­ guistic choice. (So where did that response come from? Why? How could it play  out?) Admittedly, acknowledging internal conflicts and contradictions is not our  mental strong suit as humans. From a psychological perspective, when familiar  schemas are violated, our first response is to ignore the anomaly or simply “assim­ ilate” it somehow into our schema-guided expectations. We can compartmental­ ize and hold competing interpretations, beliefs, and values quite comfortably, as it  turns out. Actually altering, or what is called “accommodating,” the schema itself  is another matter. That may require a real “confrontation with difficulties of one’s  80   Chapter 4 current schema” (Anderson 429). Moreover, rising to metacognitive awareness  of a conflict is a choice, a move from automatic or merely tacit interpretation to a  more conscious level of reflective problem solving.3 As we will see in the examples  below, this choice is often affectively triggered, but actionable consciousness for  change typically calls for more extended metacognitive work—in which writing  can be a transformative force.4 Writing toward a more actionable critical consciousness will also need to take  a student beyond many of our classroom practices for reflection on their writ­ ing.5 In the following cases, we see how a class can ramp up the familiar pro­ cess of reflection-prompted-by-experience into building a working theory with  four moves. The process starts by using theoretically grounded critical concepts  to then guide a rhetorical analysis of one’s own interpretations and actions, in  order to then create an even more sophisticated metacognitive analysis of those  actions. The final, fourth move is the work of praxis: using the insights of this  meta-analysis to develop a working theory for going forward.6 As an educational  practice, the path starts with students’ study of rich theoretical concepts, such  as (in the following cases) rhetoric’s conception of frame analysis, psychology’s  3.	  Extensively studied in educational psychology, the term “metacognition” can refer  to a tacit control process (such as monitoring a failure in comprehension that prompts us  to reread a phrase), or to a conscious access and control of one’s own knowledge or reflec­ tive understanding—an awareness educational researchers Ann Brown and Annemarie  Palincsar see as a flexible hallmark of higher intelligence. Others reserve the term for  awareness of one’s own action and the ability to articulate that awareness (Paris and Wino­ grad). The data for this study comes from that final, more powerful level of articulated  metaknowledge. 4.	  In a study of college students’ reflections on their thinking and discoveries in a tra­ ditional class, I found their series of written insights displayed strong three-way links be­ tween their affect or emotions, the context of writing, and their cognition, including goals,  options, and strategies. Even more significant, rising to this level of awareness worked as  a critical prompt to the construction of “negotiated meaning”—a sophisticated represen­ tation that engages with multiple voices as well as conflict (Flower, Construction). 5.	  Reflection has myriad forms and purposes shaped by what is reflected upon: our  own writing or a teacher’s comments (in composition studies); formative memories (in  therapy); perplexing experiences (in social interaction); and prior knowledge (in trans­ fer). For a useful introduction to classroom research and practice, see Kathleen Yancy’s A  Rhetoric of Reflection and the review of research in Chapter 2. 6.	  Here I use the phrase “metacognitive reflection and analysis” to recognize a level  of metacognition that is a self-conscious, intentional attention to our own thinking and to  articulating the work of cognition. Because the mind and its mental notebooks speak so  rapidly in multiple languages (images, propositional representations, and prose) and are  inseparable from affect, bringing this to conscious attention (much less in an articulate  version) is no small task (Flower and Hayes, “Images”). But the metacognitive process  of thinking about our thinking can let us bring to light and up for review how our often  unanalyzed, and even unrecognized ways of knowing are at work in our minds. Interrogating Hidden Frames as a Path to Change   81 mental models, or leadership’s distinction between technical problems and adap­ tive challenges. Drawing on complex concepts like these lets students map out a closely ob­ served analysis of some unrecognized interpretive frames at work in their own  experience. They are creating a guided, case-in-point analysis. Their end in view,  however, is not merely a structured academic analysis but a working theory of ac­ tionable critical consciousness—a foundation for social engagement. In taking on  this combination of intellectually complex rhetorical inquiry and an intentional,  problem-oriented, personal metacognitive analysis, writers will probably have to  construct a new negotiated meaning—one that recognizes and attempts to deal  with some of the conflicts, contradictions, and alternatives they have exposed. It  is this expanded construct that provides the basis for a working theory. By theory,  I mean a critical, conceptual construct that remains open to evidence and rein­ terpretation and is at the same time a guide to choice and action: a theory that  supports work.7 This chapter will explore two versions of this self-initiated, individual path.  One is the familiar act of a reflection triggered by experience. The other is a more  intentional effort designed to confront interpretive frames—a process I will de­ scribe as a theory-guided metacognitive analysis. In both cases, the process will  be complicated by the fact that exclusionary frameworks are often embedded in  good intentions. Case 1: When Experience Bites Back We can all relate to that uncomfortable moment when the resistant reality of  experience forced us to confront one of our own (underexamined) interpretive  frames. Liz, a white, first-time mentor at the Community Literacy Center was  working hard in her literature courses to become an insider to the Culture of Crit­ ical Discourse. Her plan for mentoring 14-year-old, inner-city Chaz was, as she  put it, “helping him to develop a consciousness that might not have been there.  He wants to be a professional football player. I challenge that. He’s a little guy, you  know. I ask him to analyze this cultural thing—football, which I don’t think is too  7.	  The concept of rising to negotiated meaning grows out of studies tracking the  thinking of both experienced and inexperienced writers and the differences in how they  respond to internal conflict as they are writing. While novices just roll on, ignoring tan­ gled or competing voices, the experienced writers stop to listen, attempting to create a  meaning (an idea, argument, a sentence) that responds to those voices (Flower, Construc­ tion). The notion of working theories, on the other hand, comes from observing the out­ comes of intercultural Community Think Tanks. The actively negotiated, documented  meaning these different groups produced was not simply a set of claims or conclusions.  Rather it was a usable, action-oriented but tentative interpretation (a theory in the form  of a revisable hypothesis) designed to address a real situation, that is, to work (Flower,  “Difference-Driven Inquiry”). 82   Chapter 4 much to ask of someone at this age level” (Flower, Community Literacy 118). But  Chaz wasn’t the only skinny Black kid who talked this line. Did Liz understand  what this sort of aspirational boast actually meant for him? Was it an identity as­ sertion to her, just a part of teen talk, or . . . ? Did she think to find out? Another mentor named Dianna, an elegant, West Coast, middle-class Af­ rican American senior, seemed to be taking umbrage at our discussion about  “Black English.” I had been sharing with the teens the influential linguistic re­ search of William Labov (arguing for Black English as a legitimate dialect in  the face of the public schools’ choice to penalize it) and Geneva Smitherman’s  examples in Talkin’ and Testifyin’: The Language of Black America. My “socially  engaged teacher” interpretive frame prompted me first to describe/clarify some  of the distinctions in grammar and diction between “standard written” and  “Black” English. Secondly, in order to help these teenage writers consider the  linguistic choices open to them, I intended to challenge the assumption many  held that “this is just my bad English.” Even if one option was expected in school,  here they were writing from and about urban teenage life. Their texts would be  published and circulated in a newsletter they titled Risk and Respect, and some  would be translated into performance and dialogue with the audience at the  project’s closing Community Conversation. For many teenage writers, giving  this formal standing to Black English had been a liberating new concept, letting  them choose to use (and edit for) standard written English and switch to their  own dialect for dramatic and rhetorical effect. But to my surprise, my educated  college student was clearly resisting this solidly supported academic perspective,  even angry that I was promoting it. Perplexed, I asked to have lunch with Dianna (and her brother, who was in  town) at a nearby café to talk it over. It was only then that I discovered, first, that  she could not herself speak the “Black English” of our urban teenagers—some­ thing she did not wish to reveal to them. And secondly, in her interpretive frame  (for what I saw as a liberating conception of the linguistic legitimacy and pow­ er of a dialect spoken by many African Americans), she saw a threat that ques­ tioned her own Black identity by equating the two. In short, there was a legitimate  conflict that had never crossed my mind, even as I, the professor, was clearly  marginalizing her in the way I presented “Black English” as an uncontextualized,  normative aspect of race: as academic commonsense. “Of course she can speak  Black English . . . she’s Black.” In this case, it took a direct conversation to elicit this conflict with my inter­ pretive frame and all that my well-intentioned philosophy had not dreamed of.  However, that was hardly enough; then came the metacognitive work of figuring  out how to acknowledge this more complex reality and still help other writers  question why they asserted that their rich linguistic repertoire was simply “bad  English.” It is one thing to point out the marginalizing frames at work in the  discourse of others. It is another, first, to recognize how your own liberal, pro­ gressive, often-academic frames are blinding you to the reality of other peoples’  Interrogating Hidden Frames as a Path to Change   83 lives; and secondly, to figure out how to act differently. Recognizing your own  automatic interpretive processes is the first step in this metacognitive inquiry, but  it is not enough merely to recognize the phenomenon. The challenge is figuring  out the working theory—how to alter them. So what follows consciousness? Growing up in Wichita, Kansas, where it  seemed to my seven-year-old self that the Black people I rarely saw all lived in a  rather forbidding territory across town. My stereotypes stayed intact upon mov­ ing to a small town in Iowa, which as far as I ever knew, included only two Black  families and two Jewish families. In college, my sorority even had to fight the  national organization to admit the one Black woman on campus at the time. That  meant, beyond a religious commitment to justice and equality, that I had a limit­ ed experiential basis from which to directly challenge some of the negative imag­ es of Black people woven into the public imagination during this civil rights era. So when, as an adult, I began to build strong intercultural connections in one  of Pittsburgh’s troubled and vibrant urban neighborhoods through the Commu­ nity Literacy Center, all that implicitly learned ideological education and igno­ rance and baggage did not simply disappear. Walking down an urban street, my  well-learned racial and class-based interpretive stereotypes could be automati­ cally triggered by an approaching Black teenager in a hoodie, slowly crossing the  street, conspicuously ignoring traffic, with his trousers apparently held up only  by a miracle. That implicit racist ideological trigger is still there. Yet in the next  nanosecond, a metacognitive awareness of that frame and its alternatives also  kicks in. And I can draw on alternative interpretations learned from teens them­ selves in which hoodies, for example, signaled teen fashion on the Northside,  not gang membership—and my awareness that police couldn’t tell the difference.  With that interpretation comes an alternative action learned in that culture: when  you meet a Black person on the sidewalk, you smile or merely nod, a simple ges­ ture merely meant to acknowledge presence. It’s a move that is common in our  Black community, whether you know the person or not. Black people give you a  comfortable nod back. After all these years, that act is still a conscious, pleasur­ able metacognitive choice. In these everyday examples, our experience, interactions, and face-to-face  inquiry can draw us all into the reflective awareness that affects behavior. I use  my own experience here to be clear that I (and I expect other educators) are not  exempt. So we design our socially engaged courses with various action agendas  that will take students beyond critical deconstruction of media and culture and  into interpersonal encounters. The interaction itself is a teacher. There are, however, less obvious forms of marginalization. Having drunk  from the cup of our culture, we carry its internalized interpretive triggers with  us. Their unbidden messages do not, however, have to dictate how we think or  act when we can confront them with an articulated alternative—the kind of in­ terpretation that is uniquely enabled by written inquiry. This account is motivat­ ed by what I learned observing students using writing to translate theory into  84   Chapter 4 a personal frame analysis with practical consequences. Let me put this cycle of  metacognitive inquiry in context. Case 2: Intentional Metacognitive Analysis This case will illustrate an alternative, self-conscious reflective practice rooted in  a theory-based examination of interpretative frames. Its structured metacognitive  analysis unpacks exclusionary assumptions as a guide to imagining a new work­ ing theory. Writers Josh and Justine were part of that socially engaged rhetoric  course called Leadership, Dialogue, and Change (Chapter 2, Case 2). Beginning  with extensive reading in intercultural theories of leadership and dialogue, it led  to a Community Think Tank around the problem of learning about and using  self-advocacy in which they documented different perspectives and the results  of their cross-hierarchy, problem-focused series of roundtable dialogues.8 The  course’s final individual paper was a four-page “personal inquiry” assignment  that asked students to consider how they had applied their personal discoveries  from the course in their own lives. Their writing suggests the distinctive kind of  insight a theory-prompted, metacognitive analysis can create. When Analysis Calls for Transformation One of the most influential tools for rhetorical analysis we studied was a frame­ work for leadership in public conflicts, developed by Ronald Heifetz at Harvard’s  Kennedy School for Government. In Leadership without Easy Answers, Heifetz  develops his theory of adaptive leadership through a series of fascinating case  studies, making a distinction between “technical problems” (ones we already  know how to manage) and “adaptive problems” that demand a new understand­ ing. Such a dilemma faced the Environmental Protection Agency in 1983. Should  they enforce regulations and in effect force the closure of an aging, out-of-com­ pliance, arsenic-spewing American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO)  plant outside Tacoma, WA—and in the process destroy a three-generation local  economy? The pressure on EPA head William Ruckelshaus—from both labor and  environmentalists—was to use his authority to treat it as a “technical problem”  and to act decisively in “their” (differing) interests. Heifetz’s model of leadership  in such a case is a dramatic departure from the stereotype of the charismatic  leader, whose acts of forceful decision-making and persuasion turn others into  8.	  This particular Think Tank was prompted by questions about students’ problem­ atic experiences in learning and using self-advocacy. Using the Think Tank’s standard  research and critical incident interviews with students, faculty, and staff, developing a  Briefing Book designed for a diverse set of participants at roundtable, problem-solving  discussions, they documented and published them as the Think Tank Findings on Self  Advocacy (Bennett et al.; Flower, “Difference-Driven Inquiry”). Interrogating Hidden Frames as a Path to Change   85 followers. Heifetz describes an even more demanding rhetorical act in which  leaders must work to draw a community (a family, an organization, and a public)  to face an “adaptive” problem. Unlike the more comfortable “technical” ones, for  which one already has expertise, standard tools, or practices in hand, adaptive  problems come with a price. They are likely to require that members of a divided  community not only learn new things but, in all probability, also reexamine and  revise some of their own assumptions and values in the context of others. Is the choice in Tacoma simply “to close or not to close?” Whose interests  should be left out: a third-generation, breadwinning worker who loses a sus­ taining job; a resident of the surrounding area who receives no profit from this  industry except its arsenic-laden, cancer-causing air currents; or the company  and its stockholders? When Heifetz’s model “gives the problem back” to the citi­ zens, months of simply oppositional debate are morphed, with the help of Ruck­ elshaus’s team, into long series of public discussions in which the different stake­ holders begin to reframe the issue into how to both protect their air and children  and also create a path to work. This was a problem they, in fact, eventually solved.  The challenge here is not to “win” but to recognize the partiality of your own  frame and the reasonable motives behind those of others—and to then create a  new “adaptive” frame and a way to carry it out. What We Observed As a good illustration of the “public turn,” this case illustrates a working theory in  action. Josh entered the Leadership, Dialogue, and Change class with significant  leadership experience. A junior in Information Systems, he was a member of the  University Leadership Consultants, a student group which offers consultations  with campus organizations “suffering [as he put it] from leadership related is­ sues”—in this case, a squash club suffering from low member turnout at events.  The consulting group had a well-developed frame for reading these “issues,” tied  to a very efficient two- to three-week process in which they would, “internally,  decide on what was best for the organization and perform a training or (stan­ dard) workshop.” Unfortunately, as Josh began to recognize, “the issue the organi­ zation was suffering with was rarely, if ever, solved.” Though “an incredibly speedy  process, it . . . resulted in unsatisfactory or meaningless results.” When it came time to write his final “applied theory” paper, Josh had already  experienced an extended cycle of inquiry, documenting and dramatizing margin­ alized perspectives as part of a diverse Think Tank deliberation. Were he to write  a standard “applied theory” paper, he could have made excellent use of Heifetz’s  leadership theory to analyze the problematic practices of the consultants. However,  this paper was asking for a more direct application to one’s own practices and the  thinking behind them, in order to make personal use of what had been learned. Starting with Heifetz’s concept of engaging a community in dialogue, Josh  describes beginning to see limitations in his own, quite self-conscious model of  86   Chapter 4 “servant-leadership,” which he says he had advocated “since high school . . . I fell  into the trap of a technical leader who was more focused on solving tasks.” This  would matter when it turned out that the squash club’s “low-turnout” problem  wasn’t with the no-shows or the organization’s advertising at all, but instead with  a dysfunctional leadership team, which never worked as a group to figure out  what events new members might actually want to come to. Josh’s text goes on to articulate the outcome of changing his “perspective on  leadership to an expanded value-based one.” And perhaps more usefully, he be­ gins to build an operational analysis of what this means. “Instead of asking myself  the question ‘what needs doing?’ I now ask ‘why does this need doing? What is  the real problem here? How can I engage the community?’” This self-analysis  then had a public outcome when his University Leadership Consultants changed  their process. Sitting down with the squash club, the consultants replaced their  “cookie cutter workshop” with probing questions about the club’s operations and  hinderances. They soon discovered that the club’s actual barrier to growth was  that it had no idea of how to get financial help to renovate the old courts—a prob­ lem which the consultants’ “typical recruit, retrain, and grow presentation” could  not have identified, much less addressed. Some problems, however, are not so easily resolved by following a thoughtful,  even persuasive, theory-guided revision of one’s framework. Josh had also been  a student member of the university committee that had just radically shortened  the “add/drop” period for classes. But as it went into action, he now found himself  the representative to his peers of a widely unpopular mandate. His account of  this unresolved problem is an even better example of how a written, metacogni­ tive analysis can pull out some of the assumptions the committee’s interpretive  frame brought with it—and whose needs it excluded. The committee’s ostensible,  well-intentioned policy was focused not merely on filling classes sooner (an in­ stitutional priority) but on relieving the very real stress caused by the increasing  practice of students overloading their schedules and then only dropping a class  when the damage to their learning or health had already been done. But then, as  Josh writes, “With Heifetz in mind, I wonder if that [interpretation] was actually  the case?” In his new analysis, Josh considers how the decision he supported “reeks of  an authority figure . . . attempting to ‘protect’ its community without allowing the  community to fully engage and grapple with its issues.” By focusing on a symp­ tom (late drops) rather than the problem, the new policy forces students who  can’t drop to suffer through classes they should have quit. Moreover, the policy  fails to deal with other, real sources of stress. But when you are in a leader’s chair,  you must often go beyond critique. Josh’s analysis not only raised new voices but  significantly shifted the frame to the broader issue of stress itself. Questioning  whether the committee’s solution had indeed located a real cause of stress led him  to form an inventive working theory for a more inclusive dialogue. His analysis  ends by sketching an intriguing plan for a campus-wide contest eliciting solutions  Interrogating Hidden Frames as a Path to Change   87 to stress, which would lead to a university-vetted proposal to be discussed in  campus forums. Using the theoretical lens of leadership based on inclusive di­ alogue, Josh’s metacognitive analysis let him unpack and evaluate the elements  of his own interpretive frame, what he calls “the rhetorical moves I didn’t even  know I was making!” In taking the next step beyond retrospective reflection, he  initiated a constructive act that translated understanding into everyday action  and began to develop a working theory which, as he says, “I want to bring to the  [university] committee.” It is important to recognize that in the messy and conflict-prone sites of com­ munity engagement, complete “success” is rarely the norm and our interpretive  frames for dealing with failure can play a large role in what we do next. Amanda  Tennant, Carolyn Commer, and Mary Glavan give us a provocative rhetorical  analysis of “transformative failure” in community-based projects, where a failure  frame can block our ability to see the trade-offs at work in what we did and didn’t  achieve. When the young Appalachian girls in Tennant’s summer program failed  to produce the polished but stereotypical “mountain girl” narratives the program’s  PR-focused director and donors expected, the failure frame cast its shadow on the  girls and mentors but was felt most personally by Tennant, the leader of this par­ ticular project. However, the authors use their three cases of felt failure to demon­ strate the power of a frame-probing “reflective heuristic.” By using strategies such  as seeking rival hypotheses to interrogate this dismissive interpretation they un­ covered powerful tradeoffs; that is, to produce the director’s “mountain-girl” sto­ ries would have meant overriding the self-image the girls themselves valued. Or,  using the failure frame’s focus on what didn’t happen ignored the digital skills the  girls did choose to learn. Once again, metacognitive reflection supported by a  sophisticated conceptual frame generated and transformed knowledge. When Analysis Becomes a Working Theory We left Josh trying out his new consultant’s listening frame in one case and figur­ ing out what to do with the competing frames he heard—once he actually listened  to different readings of a college policy. Justine, heading back into high school  teaching after finishing her master of arts degree in rhetoric, is concerned more  directly with how her interpretations translate into action in teaching and, in her  first case, to the tricky arena of family relations. Her metacognitive analysis starts  by putting her chosen influential concepts to work: Rethinking the purpose of deliberation will make a substantial  difference in my teaching. But on the personal side of things,  West’s notions of agency, prophetic pragmatism, and cultural  critique were eye-opening for me . . . I know my uncle is ho­ mophobic. I know he comes from a generation in which ho­ mophobia was the norm, so I usually end up writing him off as  88   Chapter 4 a fossilized bigot—mean-spirited and bitter, but basically harm­ less. I now see that my “basically harmless” judgment of him  was an oversight on my part. Now, if my uncle were discursively  isolated, a voice crying out in the wilderness, he could indeed be  harmless. But as West says, we all—as individuals—are “insep­ arable from” the “moral and political judgments and the work­ ings of a . . . critical consciousness” (24). Our culture shapes our  opinions, true, but we in turn influence our culture. My uncle’s  opinion isn’t just a mental fabrication that he keeps inside him­ self. That opinion is a vote. That opinion is a rude remark. That  opinion manifests itself in ways that keep homophobia a part of  our culture. Choosing to resee herself in West’s terms as a “culture worker” prompts a  re-interpretation of a family encounter in the form of a model, albeit a small one,  of an effort to “influence our culture”: Case in point: Three years ago, my family, including the  above-mentioned uncle, was at my house on Christmas Eve  [and something prompted] my uncle to launch into a story: “Oh  yeah, I remember back in the 80s when those two faggots killed  that kid—.” Now, I didn’t say anything to my uncle; the rule in  my family is to avoid political discussions, which inevitably de­ volve into fights, at all costs. But I gave him a look—and soon  realized that my three cousins (all in their early- to mid-20s)  were also giving him the look. He must have noticed, as he cut  himself off and tried to explain himself (“Well, that’s what we  called ’em back in the day,” etc.) before fleeing to a different table  with a homogenously older crowd. To be sure, this is not some crowning moment in LGBTQ equal­ ity. It was well within my power to call my uncle out on the slur,  even if I did end up “starting a fight,” and I opted not to. But  my cousins and I did send him a message that he heard loud  and clear: “Use that language around us, and we won’t talk to  you.” I say he heard it loud and clear because he hasn’t used  any homosexual slurs in my presence since then (although I’m  sure he says plenty of them when I’m not around). The agency  of the individual, and the notion of the individual as a cultur­ al worker, have shifted my perception of what happened here.  As I said, this moment does not mark some decisive victory in  gay rights—but it does within my sphere. It is a victory that I  helped create within the sphere in which I have power to make  a change. Interrogating Hidden Frames as a Path to Change   89 Moments of éclaircissement revealing our own casual assumptions—about  that unquestioned silence dictated by family rules or the insignificance of one’s  own inaction—can be a step toward having a voice, initiating a family dialogue  (or perhaps just becoming a family troublemaker). Moreover, Justine’s story res­ onated with others in the class, just back from Thanksgiving break with families  of Trump voters, prompting a group discussion of rhetorical options. These ex­ tended discussions of everyone’s inquiry mark a critical next phase in this cycle.  Articulating one’s thinking gives everyone an enlarged understanding. But in this  case, it also names the hidden frame, in the sense Freire and Heifetz share, as a  problem that calls for dialogue. Given that Justine was not alone in dealing with  that frame, this discussion phase created a shared space for exploring the subtle  directions this “how-to” guide is giving and the ways it can play out in different  life-worlds. Be the Change You Want to See I want to conclude with Justine’s second case in point because it takes us into a  final (visible) phase of her cycle of inquiry, where an articulated metacognitive  analysis is being translated into a working theory. For Justine, the biggest impact  on her personal and future professional life came from a challenge to her well-de­ veloped (and teacherly) interpretive frame for the nature of argument. But her  new working theory goes well beyond a theory of argument: While I learned a lot about both leadership and dialogue this  semester, I think the knowledge I’ve gained about the latter will  have the biggest impact on my personal and professional lives.  This class has profoundly altered the way I think of argument  and deliberation, and these alterations will show in my teach­ ing. Firstly, I now realize that, even as a student of rhetoric, I  didn’t even have a firm idea of what “argument” or “delibera­ tion” meant before taking this class. I’d always assumed both  more or less entailed a group of at least two people trying to sell  one another on a position. Notice how this soon turns into a richly embodied recollection that locates  these rhetorical concepts in the world of a classroom (where she expects to find  herself shortly) in an inquiry-squelching interaction with teachers and peers, or­ dered by a rule-governed tradition of teaching: I also realize that much of what I learned about argument and  deliberation in high school (and about teaching argument and  deliberation in high school) is, simply put, bad pedagogy. The  most egregious example is the “debate.” Several times through­ out my high school career, I had to engage in class-wide debates  90   Chapter 4 about contentious topics (the ones I remember most clearly  were on abortion, the Indian Removal Acts, and the ethics of  dog breeding). In all these debates, my teachers arbitrarily di­ vided the class into two teams, one “pro-issue” and one “anti-is­ sue.” We then had a week or so to confer with our teammates  and conduct research with the goal of defending our position at  all costs. During the debates, our goal was to push for our side  as much as possible while discrediting our opposition’s argu­ ments. At the end of the debate, we would usually vote anony­ mously to determine which side had “won.” This critical analysis of a traditional evaluative frame soon becomes trans­ formed into a probing, well-articulated analysis of the implications this interpre­ tive frame has for thinking. Translating educational meanings into actions, she  articulates her own teacherly frames, which include how to teach argument, how  to evaluate students, and the significance of students’ own thinking: This model of debate (which seems to fall under neither “ar­ gument” nor “deliberation”), I now realize, propagates many  harmful beliefs and habits of mind. It assumes there are only  two sides to any given issue, thus severely limiting the range of  possible positions, options, and outcomes that may emerge in  the debate. It assumes students’ authentic beliefs about an issue  don’t matter. It assumes that pushing a position one doesn’t tru­ ly support is not only acceptable, but positive. It assumes that  “good argument” means cutthroat, uncritical defense of one’s  position. It assumes that other positions exist only to be negat­ ed. It assumes that the goal of debate is to prove to the “other  team” that they’re wrong. It assumes that changing one’s mind  during the course of the debate is a sign of weakness. It assumes  that in any discussion, there are necessarily “winners” and “los­ ers.” And it assumes that persuasion is ultimately impossible: If  the goal is to “win” (i.e., persuade the other side), but changing  one’s mind means losing, then who would admit to being per­ suaded? Needless to say, I will not be employing this delibera­ tive strategy in my classroom . . . In this detailed unpacking of an interpretative frame, we can see critical  consciousness emerging in which a theoretical concept such as “deliberation”  becomes a tool for a metacognitive analysis of her own frame for “teaching ar­ gument” (not to mention the problematic little package of ideological common  sense being unpacked). Secondly, this level of analysis translates a problematic  frame into the dynamics of thinking, evaluating, and interacting with students. In  doing so, it lets her articulate actionable implications and alternatives—a working  Interrogating Hidden Frames as a Path to Change   91 theory. Finally, it suggests the power of writing, prompted by conflict, to create  actionable insight. As the paper ends, the working theory has begun to move into  a statement of possibilities, a hypothesis about potential outcomes, and a sense of  connection to an even larger educational controversy about difference. As Justine  puts it: . . . and if the whole class is going to deliberate about a common  topic, then it only makes sense that differences would have to be  considered a resource. Were we to hold to the old assumption  that differences are obstacles . . . 93 Chapter 5. Putting  Transformation to Work Always challenging our quest for certainty, John Dewey challenged the Greek  attempt to locate the meaning of an idea, such as “knowledge,” within a tran­ scendent notion of Truth. Philosophical pragmatism would, instead, locate the  meaning of a concept, such as “engaged education,” in its consequences. What  difference would it practically make to any one if this notion rather than that  were true? In what respects would the world be different if this alternative or that  were true? There can be no difference anywhere that doesn’t make a difference  elsewhere . . . (Quest 142). A secondary principle of American Pragmatism would locate “understand­ ing” (something our courses hope to engender) not in what is taught, or even is  what is learned, but in action. Pragmatism could be characterized as the doctrine  that all problems are at bottom problems of conduct, that all judgments are, im­ plicitly, judgments of value, and that, as there can be ultimately no valid distinc­ tion of theoretical and practical, so there can be no final separation of questions  of truth of any kind from questions of the justifiable ends of action (C. I. Lewis,  qtd. in West, Keeping Faith 109). The Case This final case study was engendered by curiosity about just what some of the “no­ tions” Dewey refers to could come to “mean.” Students had described the Leader­ ship, Dialogue, and Change course and engaging in its Think Tanks as a formative  experience of some kind (see Chapter 2, Case 2). I wondered what the consequenc­ es, in terms of action, might look like four, six, eight or ten years later. This case  study draws on a small, highly selective, but I believe revealing sample of the gradu­ ate students who had participated in one (out of four) of these classes over this ten- year period. One has to be skeptical about the quality and accuracy of recall over  this amount of time. Memories are open to reconstruction and any “experimenter  bias” of being interviewed by a former professor/friend. However, one indication  of impact and the kind of knowing these discussions reveal comes through in the  clarity and specificity of the outcomes they describe (as it does in critical incident  interviews). Frequently articulated with energetic certainty, they are typically fo­ cused around two or three well-articulated memories developed with examples or  stories, sometimes noting as one graduate put it: “I think about this a lot.” What I  think we can say about this method is that it captures best what stands out, after  the fact, as strongly memorable to these students. And, I believe, it suggests how  engaged humanistic courses can develop some widely valued forms of understand­ ing and a body of working knowledge that is associated in these comments with  94   Chapter 5 self-conscious leadership, reflective decision making, and independent, self-initiat­ ed learning—capacities many disciplines are eager to claim. The interview template was relatively open ended, in that it did not emphasize  the recall of course material but each graduate’s personal take away and use of  the course or Think Tank experience. Sending my questions ahead, I essentially  invited them into an inquiry with me that would pose four kinds of questions: •	 Do you recall one or two of the most important ideas or insights you took  away, not as content knowledge but as insights you may have constructed  for yourself? •	 Have you used what you learned or taught yourself in any place since? •	 Did you need to adapt or even significantly transform what you learned  to this new setting? •	 And although this may be more difficult to articulate, did this experience  transform your understanding in any way? Although this analysis will draw most particularly on the lens of leadership  and decision-making, three striking observations capture the overall character  and tenor of these outcomes: •	 First, they are highly variable—not a predictable reflection of what was  being taught. They typically take the form of quite personal insights. •	 Secondly, although the memory of a method or strategy frequently  prompted recall, that recall quickly took the form of action that typically  had public outcomes. Their learning had consequences for other people. •	 And in the majority of cases, these outcomes reflected not simply a trans­ fer of learning but a significant, purpose-driven transformation. This evidence of transformation may in fact be the most important outcome  revealed by this longer look-back. The chance to interpret powerful ideas and test  theories against the challenges of community experience opened a path to trans­ forming one’s knowing, to creatively rewriting and adapting it to new situations  and contexts. They are demonstrating one of the deeper values we can claim for  education in the humanities. Especially when it is socially engaged. Using the Lens of Adaptive Leadership Leadership, tied to decision-making and teamwork, was a foundational concept  in this course. It is a hot topic in research as well as in training programs emerg­ ing in writing, psychology, management, public policy. Its combination of theory  and practice articulates a set of skills often developed in socially engaged educa­ tion. So this lens can make a case that resonates outside our own discourse for the  kind of transferable skill also valued by managers, educators, and social activists  alike, needed in public, professional and community settings. It gives us a socially  significant lens with which to evaluate the outcomes of learning. Putting Transformation to Work   95 It also gives us a solidly grounded template for looking at our data in terms of  four significant outcomes. The first is evidence that students have been rethinking  their own definition of leadership and its rhetorical nature. Unlike an action that  is judged to succeed or fail, with this outcome students begin to re-represent lead­ ership as a form of inquiry. Secondly, they speak to transformations in their own  self-image as a leader who, quite unlike the expert in charge, is able (and willing)  to realize the complexity of a problem and bring others in. A third outcome they  described can be the emergence of a distinctive perspective that integrates theory  with the collaborative practices (as we saw in the Think Tanks), which often leads  to reflection on their current notions and a new working theory of what that  change means. Finally, for some, their stances have matured into what they call  their leadership role which, unlike a position of merely designated authority, has  been learned. In our case, students will describe a practice that combines active  listening with strategically framing an adaptive problem that will draw others  into a joint problem-solving inquiry. The source for this lens comes from Ronald Heifetz, whose work we read in  the class (cf. Chapter 4). A noted scholar at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Gov­ ernment, he nevertheless depicts an intensely rhetorical process he describes as  “adaptive work” in Leadership Without Easy Answers. His conceptual lens will  help us track a powerful outcome in which students have developed a new defini­ tion, self-image, stance and role that undergird the practice of adaptive, collabo­ rative, inquiry-driven leadership. In traditional models the leader is a charismatic  figure, an expert, or an authority, who frames the problem and by implication its  solution. He (sic) draws others (the followers) into his vision. In Heifetz’s model,  however, leaders work as collaborative change agents, where success depends on  being able to draw others to face what he calls “adaptive challenges.” This stands  in contrast to technical problems which “can be solved with knowledge and pro­ cedures in hand”—the standard ones for which you have ready-made answers.  Adaptive challenges, on the other hand, often require “new learning, innovation,  and new patterns of behavior” (Parks 10). Here success depends on something  more difficult than marketing one’s own vision, since the process can even call  for “the transformation of long-standing habits and deeply held assumptions and  values” just as we saw in Chapter 4. Being a leader in such a situation calls for strategic work, not just a better  argument or a charismatic personal style. The Think Tanks frequently plunged  students into such challenges, in cross-hierarchy, intercultural rhetorical situa­ tions embedded in actual institutional decisions or concerns (such as creating a  new Global Communication Center, recognizing a culture of stress on campus,  or ways to deal with diversity). In this discussion, the term “strategic” refers to  a kind of thinking that is planfully goal-directed, self-consciously adaptive, and  open to change based on the test of experience. It stands in useful contrast to  de Certeau’s definition of “strategic” as an institutional power move and to the  opportunistic, often practical “tactical” approach that Mathieu argues for (16).  96   Chapter 5 Drawing instead on cognitive psychology, in the alternative approach used here  “strategic” moves grow out of a more reflective process of choosing an action you  can articulate and justify, then using that experience to develop and adapt that  strategy based on what you learn. Decision research can also help us identify other features of adaptive, col­ laborative leadership that engaged courses are good at developing. For instance,  in the face of a decision a savvy leader will recognize the power of diversity and  small group meetings over large gatherings. In fact, the “best approach may  well be a series of interviews with individuals” because the “most important  element is the diversity of perspectives you assemble” (Johnson 52). Why? Be­ cause this move lets you overcome the “unconscious response in humans to dis­ cuss elements that are commonly known to other members of the group,”—the  groupthink that stifles innovation (52). A small group deliberation has a criti­ cal, individual cognitive dimension as well, because the “challenge, of course,  is how to trick your mind into perceiving that third option, or the fourth or  fifth lurking somewhere behind it” (52)—this is the “challenge of [what Johnson  calls] full-spectrum thinking” (55). Once again this is an educational issue. Early research by Paul Nutt argues  forcefully for the need to learn such a skill. His first insight was the positive cor­ relation “between the number of alternatives deliberated and success” (Nutt, qtd.  in Johnson 67). Unfortunately, he also found that only twenty-nine percent of  organizational decisions he studied considered more than one alternative. And  teenagers barely edged them out with thirty percent when confronting personal  choices. Moreover, there also appears to be a strong correlation between astute  decision-making and recognizing—and embracing—uncertainty (56). The Heifetz model, developed with powerful case studies drawn from dilem­ mas ranging from civil rights politics to environmental regulation to patient/ doctor relationships, illustrates adaptive leadership in action. But does that im­ ply that a college course can do more than describe this powerfully interactive  kind of knowing? Motivated by the reputation of Heifetz’s overflowing 90-seat  classroom in Harvard’s Center for Public Leadership, Sharon Parks fortunately  undertook an intriguing, multi-year study of his approach, published as Leader­ ship Can Be Taught, which will give us yet another lens for examining teaching  outcomes more directly. The educators’ problem is reflected in the assumption that “leaders are born,  not made.” Can the academic paradigm of transferring knowledge actually  “prepare people to exercise the judgment and skill needed to bring that knowl­ edge in the intricate systems of relationships that constitute the dynamic world  of practice” (Parks 4)? Moreover, “people must learn to see for themselves” and  they “learn best from their own experience” (4-5). What Parks describes is a  form of case-in-point teaching which includes some outcomes that could be  used to document leadership learning in our own students. The most obvi­ ous outcome is being able to move from theory to practice as a participant. In  Putting Transformation to Work   97 Heifetz’s inventive terms, that is called moving from the balcony (where one  can see larger patterns of interaction) to the dance floor. Once on the floor, stu­ dents must be able to identify the primary concerns their specific group sees, as  well as the “subtle, powerful, and unexamined assumptions they [themselves]  hold” (51). Developing leaders need to show they can think systematically about inter­ dependent forces with “a critical, systemic, holistic perspective” (Parks 53). This  includes recognizing/transforming some of one’s own assumptions about lead­ ership. The community-engaged course then works as a “holding place” to work  on this transformation in which we realize we are not “in charge” or even au­ tonomous in this radically interdependent world. Nevertheless, the actions we  do take may have more effect than we supposed. We are all complicit. Finally,  leaders need to regularly and persistently ask: “What are the (adaptive) challenges  that are emerging” here, now (59)? Using a Heifetz lens brings into focus how a  person’s way of defining leadership, their own self-image, and role—from multi­ ple perspectives—can add up to a distinctive practice of adaptive, collaborative,  inquiry-driven leadership. As we have seen, a community Thank Tank is a learning lab immersing stu­ dent in deliberative leadership that starts with their exploration of a problem­ atic issue using Critical Incident Interviews (Chapter 2, Case 2.). As we have  seen, the competing perspectives they uncover and document in their Briefing  Book give direction to a series of student-moderated Round Table discussions,  in which a cross-section of the relevant “community” is asked to define the Prob­ lem, identify Options, and consider possible Outcomes. When the new, richly  articulated foundation for deliberation and action is documented in the stu­ dent-written Findings, it can be put into circulation as both a booklet and pub­ lished on the web. Throughout the process, these students are engaged in a live  experience with a generative problem-solving process where outcomes actually  matter. This may explain why nearly everyone in this study talked about this  process of inquiry as a key takeaway, even as they adapted it for some radically  different contexts and goals. In terms of tracking, we will approach the transcribed data from my inter­ views from three perspectives. First, we do so by focusing on what stood out as  three topics of major concern for these students: an evolving definition of leader­ ship; changes in their self-image; and the connection between theory and prac­ tice. A second approach lets us examine this data in terms of those markers of  success that we saw in the leadership research. Finally, our analysis will probe  three major categories of knowledge outcomes they raised (capacity for inquiry,  collaboration, and strategic response) and how they frame the markers of success.  Table 5.1 lets us compare these three modes of interpretation. Designed to high­ light some of the parallels between them, it not only helps us elaborate different  facets of this “knowing” as James Greeno and his colleagues described it (100),  but see the wider significance and reach of these transformations. 98   Chapter 5 Table 5.1. Parallels between Perspectives of  Students, Research, and Observation Key topics the graduates brought up were Learning research sees  growth when students can Knowledge outcomes can  be described as A revised definition of  leadership as a process of  inquiry Take a critical, systemic  perspective on a consciously  adaptive process Articulated critical insights  from an inquiry, yielding  both metacognitive and  working knowledge A transformed self-image  and role See themselves as implicat­ ed in the process—not in  charge  A working knowledge  of collaboration across  difference A new perspective on theory  and practice learned from  experience Can move from the balcony  to the dance floor Actions that combine  rhetorically attuned under­ standing with a strategic  response What We Observed The following analysis explores the nature of the knowledge outcomes from the  right-hand column in Table 5.1, fleshing out the three distinctive kinds of know­ ing these graduates appear to have constructed and the uses they are putting  them to. Briefly described they are: 1. Articulated critical insights. Engaged education replaces a spectator the­ ory of knowledge-making with an experiential one—it places us in the arena, in  action. It calls out what John Dewey described as “experimental doing for the  sake of knowing.” To understand the nature of an idea, “we turn it over, bring it  into better light, rattle and shake it, thump, push and press it . . . disclosing rela­ tions that are not otherwise apparent” (Quest 70). Dewey’s metaphors anticipate  a process we might describe today as embodied learning with material effects. He  wants to make this distinction perfectly clear: “inquiry proceeds by reflection,  by thinking . . . but not, most decidedly as something cooped up within ‘mind.’  For experimental inquiry or thinking signifies directed activity, doing something  which varies the conditions under which objects are observed and . . . by institut­ ing new arrangements among them” (99). In addition, the most powerful insights students describe are typically based  on the outcomes of their own embodied experience—their encounters with  difference, uncertainty, unexpected conflict, unanticipated success. As Dewey  would argue, you grasp the real meaning of an idea when you can describe  the “conditions” in which it can exist and its “consequences.” “From the stand­ point of experimental knowing . . . the true object of knowledge resides in the  consequences of directed action” (157). And it is “the consequences” of actions  and their “connectivity within concrete experience” that let us test the nature  Putting Transformation to Work   99 and validity of ideas (92). And finally, as we will see in students’ accounts of  this engaged learning, their inquiry has achieved an impressively articulated  clarity. It is rising to this level of reflective metacognitive understanding that  can turn learning into a basis for choice. 2. A working knowledge of collaboration across difference. Rooted in ex­ perience and designed for performance, such metacognitive understanding also  remains open to change, able to function as a working hypothesis. And in this  case, the performance entailed collaboration across differences in race, culture  and status. 3. A rhetorically attuned understanding and strategic response. This may be  one of the least documented yet most significant outcomes a liberal education as­ pires to. The experience of facing challenges in highly interactive, social or public  contexts is transformed into a rhetorically attuned understanding that can guide  a strategic response. Articulated Critical Insight This first outcome to which students often referred was a significant insight or  challenge to previous thinking, and in some cases, it was a formative experience.  Some insights were recalled as one of those sudden realizations, while others ap­ peared to be larger in scope, more profound or personal. Martha’s memory is  explicit.1 I have this moment, can still see it in my head, where I was sit­ ting over in the cafe reading this and just having this like ah ha,  whoa, this is like holy cow, just like a moment of clarity . . . [On the Think Tank] One of the most profound things for me  . . . was a process of thinking through a problem . . . looking  at events or feelings and trying to embody multiple perspec­ tives. First time I really tried to do that and I saw it worked!  . . . Learned about what had happened, about my role in what  happened and also how I could have done it differently or in the  future. [Moreover,] that was really foundational for me, to think  through problems and see that I had agency; didn’t have to  passively accept what happened in that case and other possible  cases. [In contrast] to how I grew up, . . . it gave me a strate­ gy for seeing that I could, not maybe radically change things,  at least could influence them. That was really foundational  1.	  In the quoted excerpts which follow, editorial comments have been interpolated in  brackets for clarity, including the topic of discussion. The speakers vetted this chapter and  chose their own names. 100   Chapter 5 for me and then I adapted that assignment and used it in my  freshman class. We might read this last point as an instance of the transfer of an assignment  (albeit to a significantly different context). But the more revealing outcome was  her articulation of what was actually a set of experiential goals for learning that  shaped the design of her own course: I think honestly, I wanted them to have an experience that was  similar to mine. To do that process of thinking through what  happened and have those moments of realization . . . I wanted  them to do what I did [laughs], but also plumb the depths of  self-advocacy. When asked about “usefulness,” her comments switch to an on-going reflective  process on her own social agency: Significantly useful. It really shaped everything . . . For me individ­ ually it was my most foundational academic slash life experience.  And that’s why maybe I’m still [eight years later] figuring out why  that’s the case. I think it has to do with problem solving; I think  it has to do with recognizing possibility . . . even when it’s like . . . Leaders need her insight into the value of recognizing possibility despite dif­ ficulty. The challenge is translating that into knowledge you can use. Insights are  more likely to become genuine working knowledge when they are transformed  into articulated insights. Developmental psychologists Carl Bereiter and Marlene  Scardamalia can see this outcome in the psychological transition young (and  poor) writers can make from “knowledge-telling” to “knowledge-transforma­ tion.” In knowledge-telling writers can rehearse (or even knowledge-dump) what  they already know. But “transformationrequires moving from a “content space”  into a “rhetorical space” which demands rethinking, reworking one’s knowledge  into more responsive and fully developed thoughts. It is this “interaction between  problem spaces . . . that is the basis for reflective thought in writing” (“From  Conversation” 11). We can see Martha as a writer in the act of articulating and  transforming old interpretive accounts of her potential: I never felt like I was doing something, like I was making some­ thing happen . . . [It] spoke to the difficulty of getting people to  do things, or changing things for the better. It just made me see  it was possible—but that it was also really difficult. And that is  something that has probably stuck with me, since . . . I think  it is something that shows up in my dissertation too, that it’s  possible, but it’s hard. A lot of work. But for me that was hopeful  because I think prior to that I think I thought it was like “What’s  the point?” You know these things could be changed, and should  Putting Transformation to Work   101 be changed, but I [emphasis added] certainly don’t have the re­ sources or the wherewithal, or the ability or the whatever, the  authority to change them. And I think I learned that it wasn’t  about me necessarily, and that I could, we could, it’s just kind of  a matter of embracing the uncertainty and seeing the possibility  . . . Spoke to like hope. Throughout these case studies of adults, we are seeing a remarkable degree  of self-awareness linked to a style of metacognitive inquiry. They have made the  experiential leap from Bereiter and Scardamalia’s potentially “inert knowledge”  into actionable understanding—a leap which is the mark of engaged education  (“Knowledge”181). This self-awareness often includes a situated recognition of  contradiction within their own experience, as seen by Megan below: My take away? It challenged ideas about what I thought leader­ ship meant . . . as something you either succeed or fail at. For ex­ ample, I taught a lesson in class that didn’t go the way I thought it  was going to go so I identified that as failure of leadership. After  talking with you and my peers, we realized that that wasn’t the  problem . . . it was how I approached the situation, didn’t fit the  context appropriately. So one of the things I learned is it’s really  about taking positions of inquiry in deliberation. That it’s really  all very contextually based. Which make a lot of sense. Silly I  didn’t think of that before because we study rhetoric [laughs]. For Devon, learning new tools of inquiry turned into what he called his “major  revelation” when he felt the contact with the social reality of writing: That was the eye-opening. Forced to think about own writing.  It was a break through moment to think about: what is my pur­ pose for writing? At that point I was, “I’m writing this paper for  the teacher who likes . . .” [And then] I personally just said, “No  I’m writing for myself. What am I trying to achieve? What are  my purposes? What is my plan? I’m writing for the larger com­ munity and what do I want to do?” When rhetorical and analytical methods (in this case, collaborative planning and  problem analysis) are both studied and put to use in a context that can push back,  students may learn as much about their own unquestioned practices as about the  tools. In the cases which follow, students will often refer to a specific, research-based,  named strategy that was used, discussed and adapted to the project at hand. (See  Chapter 2, fn. 13 for an overview.) But what matters is what they did with it. What stands out about this sort of outcome—these articulated insights—is  how they have moved into so many different life situations, from writing and  teaching to reflecting on your upbringing and the possibility of personal agency.  102   Chapter 5 Of course, this is what education is supposed to do. But note how these outcomes  are couched in the multi-faceted language of experience shaped in social inter­ action. And like the sensitive quills of a porcupine, such knowledge can be easily  triggered by all manner of new events. From the first Community Think Tank,  this way of representing ideas had emerged as a distinctive outcome. Unlike a  standard academic or policy deliberation, these “results” were being framed as  actionable take-aways relevant to the participants and their differing social, cul­ tural, and workplace domains. This, I would argue, is the added value of engaging  with new ideas on the playing field of social experience. A Working Knowledge of Collaboration across Difference If the first set of comments captures the articulation of insight that experiential  learning can prompt, another category of outcomes shows that new understand­ ing being developed into what I have called working knowledge (Flower, “Inter­ cultural Knowledge”). That is the sort of knowledge that may be theory-based or  a hypothesis but in a form tied to practice—a kind of knowing that works. Here  we see learning being put to active use in the individual’s own research, teaching,  and, well, in places you might not expect. In these accounts, one practice that  frequently rises to the surface is the student’s new understanding of collaboration  and the role of conflict. Teamwork, of course, is highly valued in many of the professions students are  aspiring to and is frequently assigned rather than taught in many disciplines in  college. Moreover, instructors are “rarely aware of the problems students are fac­ ing” (Wolfe v) and students often equate teamwork with merely the most efficient  division of labor (Rooney et al.). By contrast, the working knowledge the Think  Tank graduates describe seems much closer to the best practices from teamwork  research, which can range from serious listening and eliciting silent stories to  using difference and managing productive conflict (Paulus and Yang). And when  that difference also includes race, gender, culture, and status, how many standard  college courses are ready to equip students with more than good intentions? Westin was facing his own challenge as a white man committed to working  across racial difference in a community project. Speaking of the leadership course: This was my most sustained teamwork project I have ever done,  still have ever done. I thought that was really great because you  don’t get that in the humanities . . . When I think about my abil­ ity to work on a team, I mostly think about this . . . In an ideal  sense you are drawing out other people’s strengths. Megan had a more personal response. Writing together was really useful for me. It took some of the  pressure off me, like feeling I had to craft perfect language . . . It  Putting Transformation to Work   103 was 100% collaborative and it took some of the burden of per­ fection off me. For some, their working knowledge shows up as a key practice in their own re­ search, especially in this case from Maureen when that research is actually fo­ cused on professional teamwork: Most memorable, first is . . . the critical incident interview. Be­ ing able to . . . reveal some of the tacit knowledge, . . . [which]  they would not be able to reveal . . . if you just asked. Versus  summarize. Tacit knowledge is one thing I’m trying to tap into  with professionals . . . [Laughs] So I definitely think about [these  two ideas] kinda all the time. Talk about transformation! Another thing is group work—also part of my dissertation  [laughs]. When I think back to the most memorable collabo­ rative experience that I’ve had, that class with the think tank  was the most memorable group work that I’ve I had. There were  challenges we faced, but the collaboration we did, part of my  research is also on productive conflict. When I think of the ideal  situation where I engaged in productive conflict, that project  immediately pops into my mind. We’d get together, have our  own viewpoints, then we would challenge each other, pull apart  ideas . . . then like merge things together. Yeah, it was incredible.  I enjoyed every single minute of it. (Maureen) As Craig Moreau discovered, this sort of productive conflict fostered by dif­ ference-driven inquiry was a real driver of innovation in professional teamwork  (“Teams”). However, in the professional writing courses he then studied, student  teams were marked by conflict avoidance and even found it “counter-intuitive.” Hap­ pily, his workshop on strategies for “productive conflict” produced some statistically  significant changes. But dealing with conflict is not easy, as he concluded: “students  need more scaffolding to see difference as a generative resource” (“Teaching” 29). Ex­ perience with situations in which your innovation might count is the ideal scaffold. As teamwork research also notes, homogeneous groups do indeed build better  social bonds but not necessarily better work (Woolley and Malone). And Mau­ reen’s experience with community inquiry locates her team’s productive bonds in  the value of a more widely shared engagement across difference. Homogenous? There was definitely diversity. [She reviews the  team’s makeup: two MAs, three undergrads, Hispanic, non-na­ tive speaker, first generation, and privileged backgrounds.] We  talked about outside experience and pulled on those to help us  come up with different plans like . . . how do we get the admin­ istration involved [She describes how one member pulled on  104   Chapter 5 his experience on the student paper, “like these are some things  we do” and another on “connecting to roots” in non-profit out­ reach.] We just pulled on these different things. It’s like I have no  experience doing either of those things. That’s amazing. What  can WE do to help out. Although the critical incident interview is basically a research method, her rep­ resentation of it sounds much more like a stance to research that became tested  and refined. I initially went into the critical incident interviews with the un­ derstanding that you’re constantly trying to push people to be  a little bit more accountable to the things that they say and to  explain those things in more detail . . . [However, the working  knowledge she went on to develop is more clearly about the in­ teractive nature of inquiry.] But I also remember [in yet another  piece of research] I kept on trying to push them too far because I  was looking for something that wasn’t there, so I realized I need  to be a little more perceptive about when to stop. (Maureen) In particular, roadblocks and problems that challenge assumptions often produce  such realizations. This graduate continued: Another thing I really took away was how to bridge gaps be­ tween different stakeholders. When we talked to admin, stu­ dents, faculty, I remember the big thing was [whether] there  was communication or lack of communication and misconcep­ tions about what other groups thought . . . I remember [at a  round table, some of the administrators] had absolutely no idea  what was going on with the students, just like so mind blowing  to me; how do you guys not know this? It’s right in front of your  faces, right under your nose! Then I realized there is a certain  kind of information that just gets circulated in these groups.  And because there can be such insularity . . . that it’s really hard  to be aware . . . Yeah, of course, people should be talking to one  another, but taking that class made me really realize the gravi­ ty, the importance of getting people to communicate with one  another across these differences. Now it’s something even in my  research I am trying to bridge, in technical communication [in  college and workplaces]. (Maureen) Difference takes many forms. In this next excerpt Andre describes a tech­ nique he, as a teacher, imported into his Public Problems course. (His students  called the technique “a kind of Creative Thinking.”) When I asked if there were  any parallels to our course, his response was rather emphatic. Putting Transformation to Work   105 Useful? Oh yeah, oh my gosh, absolutely. The process of Rival­ ing. For writing proposals . . . Shaped how I taught. Constantly  trying to get students to think about alternative perspectives or  how adequately are they representing the voices of other people  who have a stake in this issue. (Andre) Here a strategy for responding to difference could mean a fundamental shift  is how you envision stakeholders and an audience. It’s not like who you are writing to in academic lit or to people you are writ­ ing about in your topic area, but they are the people who live  right next door to you or [whom you] attend classes with that  are making decisions . . . Having had some experience dealing  with a public problem in the Think Tank, where the stakes are  real, . . . absolutely influenced [my teaching]. Of course, it’s reassuring to see the usefulness of specific applications you may  teach toward (as when students say, “I did value being able to bridge theory and  practice.”) Or when a graduate comments: “I think back to think tank approaches  and how I can implement them in my research right now” or with a graduate ad­ visor. However, other uses—of say, problem analysis—turn up in unlikely places: Another big takeaway—naming things, giving something a  name. . . . in my research and in my personal life . . . being able  to have a reference that links a bunch of ideas together and be­ ing able to talk about it . . . My boyfriend and I get into debates  . . . Politics, . . . we unpacked this term conservative . . . where it  came from . . . I was telling him, there just wasn’t a term conser­ vative, (it) described values . . . (Maureen) What these comments help document is first how the knowledge people de­ scribe is not just propositional, but is a form of working knowledge. That is, that  special form of knowing that is grounded in concepts, theory, or methods, but has  also been transformed into socially embedded practices (like persuading your  boyfriend). And the well-articulated character of this conceptual understanding  is what makes those practices both testable and revisable. This second outcome,  not surprising for a community-based experience, is the enthusiastic capacity we  see for working collaboratively across difference. This striking outcome can be  hard to come by in academic settings (Bennett et al.). A Rhetorically Attuned Understanding and Strategic Response Perhaps the most intriguing and complex outcome of engagement is this third  one: the sophisticated form of knowing that emerges when students try out both  theory and rhetorical practice in live contexts. The experience not only prompts  106   Chapter 5 them to draw on learned insights, but to do so with a more rhetorically attuned  understanding of the situation. They are able to transform knowing into thought­ ful and strategic responses to challenging social interactions. Secondly, they are  doing this with a remarkable level of metaknowledge that lets them articulate and  evaluate their own choices. From an educational point of view, as we saw in Ryan  Roderick’s work on self-regulation (Ch 2) documenting this level of reflective  and clearly conceptualized self-knowledge can make a powerful statement about  learning and the usefulness of engagement. Having evidence of longer-term effects is obviously relevant to our case for  the humanities and engaged education in particular. Can we show that such  courses build not only personal agency and social responsibility, but also skills  valued in our public and professional lives? How do these skills stack up against  social expectations for, say, productivity, knowledge building, teamwork, or lead­ ership? The interview questions asked these graduates for evidence of transfer,  such as, if or when they used the course or the Think Tanks tools for inquiry on  their own. However, the following accounts are better described as the result of  a transformation. In this process of adaptive re-creation, the first step is often not tinkering  with a rhetorical tool but working from a new starting point they described as a  change in “how I think about . . .” Or “how I approach . . .” And from here gradu­ ates describe the experience of strategic knowledge building, creating related but  novel moves, intentionally adapted to specific challenges, from leadership to job  hunting. In a nice example of traditional transfer, a graduate laughingly describes how,  yes, the various methods of the Think Tank shaped her own research: “I used  the Think Tank method to motivate my dissertation research method . . . How  to bring people together to collaboratively solve a problem.” But when asked if  she has thought any more broadly about the model of leadership we studied, her  picture of on-going, creative, self-directed performance emerges: I never stopped thinking about it. Taught it to my first-year writ­ ing students, then [a colleague] and I organized a conference  [for a national organization] on how to be a graduate leader . . . I  think of my research as being about writing as leadership. . . be­ ing an academic leader . . . I think about that a lot . . . [“About” I  ask, “transforming your understanding?”] Transformed the way  I think about leadership . . . Informed the way I see myself as a  leader . . . When you first gave us that assignment, I thought, “I  don’t see myself as a leader.” Transformed the way I think about  my work, . . . now as a professor . . . as a woman . . . and having a  role in the university where I have some power. (Amy) I don’t think it was like “transfer.” For me it was more individ­ ual, it kind of influenced how I approached what I was doing,  Putting Transformation to Work   107 whether it be teaching, my own research, my own [laugh] life. I  think it helped me keep asking questions. [“How come?” I ask.]  Because I embraced the idea that problems are never as simple  as we think they are . . . Bringing in other people. That has really  stuck with me on so many areas . . . But I feel like that prob­ lem-solving stance has to be adapted. (Martha) For Dasen, the process of “adapting” starts with a new way of thinking about  problems and collaborative leadership from which he creates some original, in­ ventive practices of his own. The Think Tank process was very illuminating . . . What I  learned from that, what I took away as valuable from that, “We  think we know . . . Oh, here’s a problem; here’s the solution.”  We think we know the solution. Well, we really don’t know the  solution. We’ve got to get behind the solution; we’ve got to in­ vestigate. And I’ve taken that in two different ways. Which for him turns out to be not just two, but a set of radically different adap­ tations to being an executive officer in an organization, on the one hand, and to  being a part-time student, on the other. And when I first took over [this leadership position] I actually  sat down and talked it out with each of department heads to  find out what are the issues, what am I not seeing, and how can  I best assist. These questions, these techniques are things I think  I learned from the Think Tank. And I also learned . . . As he goes on to describe these situated, reflective translations, their strategic,  adaptive nature becomes clear. On the job market . . . I invoked my experiences with the com­ munity think tank, I even gave . . . them a copy of the . . . ma­ terials and . . . link to the website, that I was a part of! . . . To  demonstrate I’ve got some experience thinking about these  larger issues . . . Got offered a job. So it helped [laughs]. . . . I’m  thinking about rhetoric and leadership from both a theoretical  and practical perspective—and in my dissertation as well. [And  that was not all.] And I’ve applied it in different situations, in  my home life: just talking to people and listening to people and  really getting the Story-Behind-the-Story. There is clearly an impressive individual personal stance that stands behind  this portrait of knowledge transformation across contexts. It builds on a disposi­ tion and ability that is not created by a class, however strong its reported impact.  On the other hand, from the perspective of leadership and decision making, one  108   Chapter 5 outcome more directly attributable to engaged learning is this strategically con­ structed metaknowledge which gets articulated as his “own leadership style.” The  capacity for such knowledge making clearly has reach, showing up in both teach­ ing and in the following case, in job hunting. I thought about it as a listening tour. I actually use the phrase, “a  listening tour.” That’s what I got out of me doing interviews for  our Think Tank. Essentially what I am doing is listening. That’s  part of my leadership style . . . listening to people I may neces­ sarily have authority over . . . people who are involved may have  better ideas, better strategies. (Dasen) In teaching returning veterans, he, like Martha, adapts collaborative planning to  recreate his own learning experience, to get them, as he says, “at the beginning, to  help get them thinking, to stimulate metacognition.” Another feature of socially engaged learning is the way it can disrupt not just  prior knowledge, but practice. As Megan relates, the community context “chal­ lenged some ideas I had about what leadership meant and how I see myself in re­ lation to that concept.” What Megan recalled, however, is not just a tool or meth­ od but how this experience with a demanding situation shaped her performance,  as well as her attitude and confidence. Having to the facilitate a Round Table itself . . . [in a later] simi­ lar situation I felt a little more comfortable jumping in . . . asking  “could you go back to . . .” Felt I would be able to adapt, to react  to what others might do or say. This comfort dealing with problem-solving, inquiry and/or uncertainty also  turns up in changes in her practice in teaching and research. [Another] thing I think about a lot, that’s rivaling . . . That’s  something I find myself doing with myself with the work I do  . . . Analyzing something and I think “This is what the problem  is or I am reading it this way?” I say well, what if it’s not that way,  what if it’s something else, or why do you think it has to be that  way, why can’t it be something else? [In teaching] It make me feel less prescriptive . . . Now a little  more flexibility in what you can do in a classroom. Now, “here’s  the goal, if it doesn’t happen that way, we’ll figure it out!” Because the experience of a community-engaged class working toward real out­ comes can raise the stakes and relevance of one’s choices, it is more likely to force  a reconsideration of old assumptions. Working with people I would never otherwise work with, ex­ posed me to different ideas and different approaches to tasks,  Putting Transformation to Work   109 and I remember thinking, “Why did they do it that way! I didn’t  do it that way!” . . . Initially it was uncomfortable; I didn’t like  it, cause I couldn’t control it [laughs], but . . . now I can see the  connection to . . . working with different faculty members . . . to  see things from their perspective. (Megan) The challenge of carrying out effective social interactions comes up frequent­ ly in these comments. For Andre like Dasen it starts with reading the situation.  For him what “stuck” as the “Number 1 insight from the readings” was the “ways  people conceptualize problems in a deliberative or decision-making space . . . It  shaped the way I think about problem[-solving] strategies . . .” More significant  was the next step when he used Heifetz’s distinction between technical and adap­ tive problems to shape a strategically attuned understanding of what was happen­ ing in a non-profit organization he had started to work with. In the midst of a discussion, in the back of my mind I recog­ nized, as I was hearing what the person was saying. [It was  that] tendency to gravitate to, “Oh let’s find a solution” . . . [in  place of] a more labor- intensive process of figuring out what  their problem looks like from multiple perspectives, then ac­ tually figuring out a way forward that weighs those against  each other . . . This sort of “fundamentally useful” metaknowledge, which he attributes to “do­ ing the interviews for that course work,” in turn shapes his strategic response. In  practical situations and his own research, you need to know: How to think on your feet about the kinds of questions you are  asking and what you want to get from that interview. How to  reflexively handle myself in these situations. (Andre) The path of transformation, however, is not straight forward. Some, like this  graduate student Westin, explicitly reject or “don’t relate to transfer,” focusing  instead on the work of building their own model which Westin describes as: “I  watch you, saying, ‘I am going to also take a stand in this difficult thing.’ You gave  me one model or template for doing that.” The path Westin recalls involves both  difficulties and potential outcomes, starting with his skepticism about the whole  practice of local deliberation, and his question: Is that [process] successful when it becomes institutional? . . .  Not sure . . . At the time I was much more skeptical. Yet in the next breath: This was the most productive entry point for me in all of my  course work about thinking through an individual scholar’s  agency within an institution. By far. Who else even tries? 110   Chapter 5 Speaking on the “model” he saw: It was a very difficult class to know what we were learning at  the moment. But I think that’s your teaching philosophy, so . . .  I continue to think about Heifetz’s “technical” versus “adaptive  challenge.” As an aside, he notes: I thought in a faculty [job] interview, how I would be able to  politely ask, “What’s the last adaptive challenge that your de­ partment has faced?” And if they can’t say anything, that would  be a sign to me. [laughter] Then back to the difficulty of all the new terms, But what I eventually internalized is, I name them as scaffolding  strategies for getting people to talk. I’ve really taken that ques­ tion with me. When I ask: “The question?” he replies: How do we scaffold people into inquiry? Not a small question. As Westin suggests, this path of transformation is often  motivated not by the current situation, but by the desire to nurture an aspiration  or vision in a complex (sometimes seemingly intractable) social setting or insti­ tutional practice. Our final account of transformation introduces just this sort of dilemma, sug­ gesting why learning in the context of a live, socially engaged learning experience  may be so significant when we pose the question: So what? The biggest impact was the power of how you define a commu­ nity problem. .   . [As in, “We don’t have an XXX Center.”] We  were assuming we had the solution in how we were defining it.  A big moment for me . . . the process of redefining . . . Num­ ber One I think. That continued to stay with me as I became  involved in university work . . . I became very attuned to how  people were defining the problem at hand . . . Transformed for  me how to participate . . . and how to take on leadership roles  [when you need to] get people to define a problem in a different  way. Doing that in a meeting was something I think I got from  doing the Think Tank. (Katherine) The capacity to draw folks into re-defining a problem was called into play  again when Katherine’s campus group had, as she said, already dived into the  “rabbit hole of getting data” on the solution to a problem they had already  framed as “We need a Child Care Center!” To replace that process of solving a  Putting Transformation to Work   111 “technical” problem with inquiry, Katherine reframed the proposed solution as  a question: “Well what were the issues the graduate students were having . . .?”  And her approach was to pose that question at a regional conference, where the  tendency was, they always want to make a survey. My take was . . . we started  hosting lunches on their experiences . . . mixed with critical in­ cident interviews . . . [And] found out we needed to understand  what people were already doing . . . [and recognize there had  been a] big change in graduate demographics. The strategic nature of her knowledge transformation (into what she calls “certain  principles I followed”) stands out when the members of the national project she  directed wanted to devise a strategic plan. In making their case, many groups  wanted to produce a student bill of rights. . . . In a leadership role it felt  to me like a big choice that really weighed on me. On the one  side, there was the more activist side. Framing [the response] as  a bill of rights had the potential to empower students. On the  other hand, what the community think tank bought into the  picture was “What does it mean when you’re trying to make an  institutional change?” . . . I remember you saying, “But how do  you think [that an administrator] is going to feel when she reads,  or . . . the department head . . . you are going to circulate this  around campus . . .” It kind of became my approach to dealing  with the graduate students. It opened me up to having to think  about other institutional actors and also hierarchy . . . Doing the  community think tank helped me think strategically about how  to use certain forms of hierarchy, bringing certain people into  these things, and how you often needed their leverage. Her comment about a simple exchange between student and professor is a  nice example of constructing a practice from an idea. Like a Bakhtinian utterance  that implies a response, Katherine translates my simple problem-posing question  into a model of intervention and interaction. And that transformation occurred,  as is often the case, when a conflict pops up, well after the class is over. There were things I didn’t get at the time. Like trying to make  the Think Tank reporting be “dialogic.” Don’t think I really quite  got that [laughs.] . . .Maybe I understood the principle of it, but  it wasn’t until I was in a situation where I could start the see  the problems [when the group] wanted to create institutional  policy like documents, wherein they had a very clear solution  of what they were trying to go for and I’d walk into the meeting,  112   Chapter 5 knowing “No one’s ever going to go for this.” It’s like one idea; it’s  not budging; it’s not showing other perspectives; we’re doomed  . . . I began to see, “oh right, when we go into these things, we need  to bring in, we need show a bit of a dialogue.” Somewhat similar  to what they talk about as transfer, but I don’t think it was some­ thing I got and I was transferring; it was more like a delayed,  putting-it-together. I felt like it was always at times when it felt  like something didn’t work. At the time I thought that part of trying to represent this in  a dialogic way came out of a sense of principle that that was  somehow also the right thing to do, to represent all the different  stakeholders, but I think it was in these moments of also seeing  it as a strategic move. Katherine’s description of “using things from this class” extends to a controversial  choice between working like an activist (“We just need to go on strike!”) or more like corporate  leadership . . . . But how are grad students supposed to adapt to  either of these models? So I was trying to find a way to use the  approach in the community think tank model. It had a way I  could see it straddling or blending parts of this . . . It spoke to  a position graduate-student leaders are often facing . . . Which  model, what kind of framework am I using to approach this? For this graduate, the process moves into a larger intellectual arena of shaping  educational policy and the experience of negotiating among different problem  frames. But the cognitive move is not the transfer of tools, but rather a way of  constructing a challenging new question for herself as an act of inquiry. Note,  too, how this form of knowing is built progressively, a constructive process set  in motion when she encounters a new problem. Along this path, her “biggest  insights” come to influence my own research interest in education policy . . . This class actu­ ally started to shape my research interest, trying to understand,  if the problem I was really interested in was how to change or  how to shape some these policies. A lot of the focus was always  on these critiques . . . and the thing that was the big shift for  me after this class and for my later work, was actually looking  to, “Well, what were other people either in higher education or  in other professional organizations, what were they doing that  influenced, or didn’t, any of this other stuff?” I think there was  an orientation shift . . . Putting Transformation to Work   113 When this focus on inquiry turns up in teaching, it is again on a personally de­ fined problem I can’t teach a community literacy course . . . A dream course.  So I adapt. [In her workshop on writing a research proposal, she  sees the educational goal as seeking] knowledge that we don’t  have, something that we need to understand . . . [on the] prob­ lem, defining and how we make that compelling. As other participants have mentioned, the desired outcome of this teaching goes  well beyond transfer to instead construct the kind of experience she had had. wanted them to see with their own experience, as students, their  own senses of expertise . . . Create something where they had  some level of their own situated expertise to bring to it . . . build  from community problems here. (Katherine) Like her aspiration to create dialogic encounters, this is a rhetorically strategic  response emerging from both that “sense of principle . . . the right thing to do”  and sustained adaptive reflection. It is rather hard to sum up all these innovations, interpretations, aspirations  people see as linked to an often-distant experience in a course. That is as it should  be, because what they are tracing are paths of transformation. Out of the inter­ action between theory and practice that engaged learning can offer, each has de­ veloped and can articulate a richer rhetorical understanding of new situations  tied to their own distinctive, thoughtfully strategic response. Other community  linked courses will combine academic ideas with personal engagement in dif­ ferent ways and are likely to produce different, but related learning outcomes.  However, what we are seeing is the nature of learning that an engaged education  is in fact creating–and the value of tracking it. 115 Chapter 6. Teaching for Transformation  Writing educators must challenge the public perception of writing, so argued  Linda Adler-Kassner in her 2017 Conference on College Composition and Com­ munication (CCCC) chair’s address (“Because Writing”). As we noted in Chapter  1, she targeted the impoverished perception of what writing does as a force that  shapes not only communication but also learning, identity, ideology, ideas and  change. But she saved her well-documented attack for the economically moti­ vated re-definition of instruction as a fast and narrow chute to a job which con­ tributes to the economy. This route to “the profitable moment” (326) has no place  for embodiment or encounters with uncertainty, conflict, or contradiction, what  she calls “troublesomeness.” This reductive view has in turn spawned a tidy set of  criteria which identify and calculate achievement with a measurable set of com­ petencies designed for workplace success (322). Like the “crisis in the humanities,” this battle is being fought in operational  terms over how we define and measure learning. When the very term measure  replaces the goal of showing evidence of learning, we have reduced its more com­ plex, ultimately more essential, outcomes to what is easy or convenient to count. So one motivation for this research has been to explore ways to discover, doc­ ument, and more publicly represent some of the significant and distinctive out­ comes of community-engaged education. And on that foundation to advocate  for the privilege of teaching at the intersection of rhetorical theory, research, and  social experience that supports a fully engaged education. Yet as Adler-Kassner  suggested, the problem is that we haven’t effectively challenged the mindset and  methods of measurement with an alternative art of documenting and publicly  representing critical outcomes that reach beyond the classroom. Working in that direction, one of the success stories of the past decade has  been discovering ways to rethink the meaning of and ways to teach for transfer.  At the same time, as we saw in Chapter 1, transfer is a very contextually attuned  practice. And being aware of that is critical to effective teaching (Roderick).  Teaching, that would support not only transfer but the transformation of knowl­ edge, sets the stakes even higher. Upon encountering a new rhetorical situation,  writers need to realize that their prior knowledge will need to adapt to a social  interaction, that learned practices are subject to revision, and that the writer’s  identity is on view. Moreover, as educators we know there is no “best” way to do  that—to prepare students to enter a social/cognitive/affective event in which, as  Dana Cloud would say, “reality bites.” Given the polymorphous nature of engaged  education, I expect each of us has worked toward some version of these goals in  our own circumstances. I want to be clear that the case studies sketched in this book are not an argu­ ment for a particular curriculum. However, I do believe, that in combination the  116   Chapter 6 approaches explored here, point to two conceptual frameworks that can support  more fully engaged learning. They do this work by posing useful questions we  can ask of a course or project. One framework building on activity theory would  ask: how are we helping students engage with their project’s larger activity system  by asking: •	 First, are we reading a situation to uncover its Contradictions (where  practices, ideas or values come in conflict in order to discover in them  openings for Change? •	 Then, how are we Collaborating within a Contact Zone across different  perspectives, experiences, values? Are we partners in Inquiry or is differ­ ence an obstacle to be overcome? A second framework would ask: how can we help students work as grounded-the­ ory builders by asking ourselves: •	 How might I adapt the process of Grounded-Theory Building to students’  learning? •	 Researchers use the powerful moves of Grounded-Theory Building to de­ velop a normative theory. But can students use these moves to build a  more contingent and adaptable Working Theory? •	 And am I teaching Theory Building directly? Are my students translat­ ing theory into action guided by a new Metacognitive Awareness of their  choices, decisions, and outcomes? •	 Finally, the path to transformed and transformative learning will lie not  in what we teach, but in what students do. The Grounded-Theory Guide  which concludes this chapter invites students themselves to reflect on  their own theory-informed process of engagement, and to articulate  where have they had the most success and where the hurdles lie. Engaging with a Larger Activity System.  Students in an engaged course may quickly realize they are entering some sort  of educational adventure, but they may not recognize the complexity of reading  and writing that is at stake in this new social/cultural/historical activity system,  such as Yrjö Engeström describes (“Developmental Studies”). The course itself is  an activity system: 1) working within the traditions of education, the university,  the program, as well as the local norms of a community culture; 2) using mediat­ ing tools, including lectures, papers, grades, discussions, joint planning sessions,  written guides and even local dialects; 3) operating with divisions of labor among  students, teachers, TAs, program chairs, advisors, community organization staff  and participants, each with their own role and place in the division of labor, hi­ erarchy, and power structure. Among all those active forces they need to consid­ er which ones are making a difference. And finally, how do students represent  Teaching for Transformation   117 themselves, as well as the unvoiced contradictions, all within the larger activity  system that their socially engaged class has entered? How does our course turn  activity theory into a new way of seeing? The practice of “early uptake” (see Chapter 3, Case 1) is a clear example of  re-seeing which worked to understand the needs of Phoenix’s South Sudanese  immigrant women—before automatically sending them to one of the communi­ ty’s standard “literacy” classes (Long, Responsive). That means, before opting for a  ready-made solution to what leadership theorist Ronald Heifetz calls a “technical  problem,” we are choosing to face a more demanding “adaptive” one. Recogniz­ ing the failure of many programs to be genuinely useful, this practice of “early  uptake” started with listening and participating in order to understand the highly  gendered economic and social power structures of the Sudanese diaspora com­ munity. Coming to grips with this complex and unfamiliar activity system un­ covered some of its critical contradictions, such as an immigrant culture in which  women have to be both primary breadwinners as well as family/home managers.  This early uptake saw the striking incongruity between the genre-based assign­ ments of the university’s literacy outreach classes and the women’s real uses for  literacy as both personal sensemaking and advocacy. For educators to self-con­ sciously grasp, much less play a role in, this activity system called for new tools,  such as active observation or engaging in multi-voiced collaborative planning. As  described by Elenore Long, Jennifer Clifton, and their associate Roda Nyapuot  Kuek, this led to inventing a “positional mapping” practice that traced the “cul­ tural flows” in this South Sudanese community, which, in effect, determined the  expectations placed on these women (Long, Responsive 185-216). Working with  this larger picture, their “responsive rhetorical art” had reverberations through­ out its wider activity system. A school-sponsored representation of a service or a course such as this is  often built around what we are already prepared to do—what Heifetz would call  managing that “technical problem” (8). To think beyond requires not only dip­ ping your toes in an experience but thoughtful critical analysis, guided by pow­ erful conceptual frameworks, such as activity theory or frame analysis. It is this  ability to step back from the context provided in a college course and use its  strategies to construct an equally complex but different representation of engage­ ment—a transformation that occurs at the level of a social, cognitive, cultural and  historical activity system itself. Reading a Rhetorical Situation: Analyzing an Activity A good place to engage this way of seeing is to analyze with your students the  rhetorical situation they are entering—which is likely to be a particularly dynam­ ic one. In the famous Bitzer/Vatz debate over this concept, Lloyd Bitzer’s rhetor  needs first to grasp the exigence, “an imperfection marked by urgency” (qtd. in  Vatz 156). That is, to ask what stands behind this need to speak or write, right now  118   Chapter 6 (especially when it is not a mere assignment), which is linked to the nature of the  audience and the constraints surrounding this situation? Richard Vatz’s rhetor,  however, also needs to recognize that the situation is created by what we choose  to pay attention to and the interpretative act that translates it into meaning (157). In “Political Rhetoric” Bitzer speaks even more directly to what the student  must deal with, given some sort of evolving exigence an engaged course is likely to  enter. Rhetorical concerns, then, are mainly probable, contingent, interest-laden,  and frequently in contention. These characteristics mark the central realm of activ­ ity for rhetoric, which is the practical world of human affairs. Here rhetoric labors  between the challenge and the fitting response, the imperfection and the remedy,  the crisis and the calm. This, Kenneth Burke colorfully remarked, “is the area of the  human barnyard—the big scramble” (qtd. in Bitzer, “Political Rhetoric” 8). Has my class led students beyond acquiring a useful transferable genre, such  as proposal writing or a public statement, into practicing the transformative art  of probing, analyzing, interpreting, responding to the real rhetorical situation?  (And are they also realizing that “real” is only a heuristic, an interpretive fic­ tion we create in order to act?) Do they see their response to this situation as a  step in Dewey’s “experimental” way of knowing (Quest 132)? Not satisfied with  comfortable or easy answers, our “knowing” is simply a current best hypothesis  subject to the test of reality. This last point is perhaps essential to a meaningfully  transformed application of learning: my classes and their expectations are over  in 14 weeks—socially engaged situations tend to call for re-reading and reenter­ ing the fray.1 Conventional or narrowed readings of the rhetorical situation have conse­ quences. David Coogan’s well-supported argument for a materialist rhetoric de­ scribed a dramatic, revealing failure when his class plunged into a campaign for  neglected local public schools, publicly naming the problem as the need for “local  control” (672). They read the situation as a familiar political advocacy call for  neighborhood representation on local school boards. Unfortunately, they failed  to uncover the politics of “local control” or share the residents’ history with that  agenda, which had merely resulted in surface policy changes soon co-opted by  Chicago’s city council. His class had entered a larger system that included a history and a set of  1.	  In an intriguing case in point, Dr. Wayne Peck, director of Pittsburgh’s Community  House, trained two groups of community literacy interns to write an argument to the City  Council advocating for a caring response to hunger in the inner city. One practiced the  text-based strategies of Toulmin’s data-warrant-claim scheme for argument. The other fo­ cused on a rhetorical representation of the participants and their goals—assessing values,  attitudes, and beliefs and learning to strategically address the rhetorical complexity and  social dynamics of the situation. Independent judges found that although the text-based  instruction produced the best organized letters, they also agreed that they were unlikely  to have any effect on the city council. It took the rhetorical/social instruction to create  persuasive and powerful advocacy. Teaching for Transformation   119 rhetorical tools wielded by powerful institutions—such as the trick of assigning  public titles and meaningless roles to citizens within an institutional structure.  But in a subsequent—successful—attempt at community organizing for schools,  Coogan drew on the more powerful tool of ideographic analysis, shifting his fo­ cus from political legislation to calling parents, students, and teachers to take “lo­ cal responsibility” on themselves. Opening their eyes to the larger activity system  and its contradictions led to redefining the problem, revising their rhetoric, and  in some meaningful ways, rewriting the situation. It also worked. Frame analysis is another powerful tool, especially when two frames are com­ peting for turf in our activity. For instance, you may think of hunger with the  standard “individualist” frame that tends to guide policy and the action of many  non-profit “food-recovery” groups, where volunteers transport grocery stores’  outdated surplus to local food banks. However, when Alex Helberg compared  just this sort of non-profit, Pittsburgh’s 412 Food Rescue, with another anti-hun­ ger organization, he found them to be “vying for political hegemony” within the  city, working from what he described as two radically different, competing “po­ litical imaginaries.” (See also Chapter 4) Food Not Bombs, a local member of  the anarchist movement, is a direct-action activist group. Its public potlucks are  designed not only to raise awareness of and combat local hunger and food inse­ curity, but also to double as attention-getting political demonstrations. 412 Food Rescue’s framework was designed to solve the “emergency” problem  of hunger with methods of “food recovery,” whereas Food Not Bombs attacks  the individualist framing that dominates the broader political rhetoric. Hunger,  they assert, is a large-scale societal problem (Helberg 7-8). The hungry people in  Pittsburgh are evidence not of an individualist problem but a large-scale, societal,  systemic problem. So what can follow from an activity analysis of complex situations like these?  As educators, we are good at giving students tools for different kinds of analy­ sis (cultural, discourse, feminist, etc.), for making critical appraisals of rhetorical  situations, and for constructing well-formed arguments in appropriate genres.  Good analysis, however, is only a precursor to action.2 In the case of community  2.	  In a challenging comparison of a high-stake formal education versus on-the- ground engaged learning, consider the forms of “non-traditional education” that go on in  urban neighborhoods in crisis—in churches, Black newspapers, and community groups.  This sort of engaged education comes to life when Derek Handley takes us into the his­ torical and rhetorical resistance of three Black urban communities (Pittsburgh, St Paul,  and Milwaukee) facing destructive “urban renewal” in the 1950s and 60s. His study shows  us what a rhetorical education for community action had to accomplish. The leadership  seminars in Milwaukee that sprang up had no small task: “to (develop) in students a com­ munal and civic identity and [a program that] articulates the rhetorical strategies, lan­ guage practices, and bodily and social behaviors that make possible their participation in  communal and civic affairs” (Enoch 8-9, qtd. in Handley 106). These seminars offer an exceptional model for engaged education within a community.  120   Chapter 6 engagement, one of the real challenges is becoming collaborative partners across  difference—and to not only overcome but to, in fact, put that difference to use  (Flower, “Difference-Driven Inquiry”). Collaboration in a Contact Zone: Entering an Activity As an engaged educator, the next question I would ask myself here is, how am I  helping my student go beyond the experience of difference, as powerful as that  may be, to interacting with self-awareness within a contact zone? An influential  article by Louise Pratt back in 1991 defined contact zones as “spaces where cul­ tures meet, clash, and grapple with each other, often in contexts of highly asym­ metrical relations of power, such as colonialism, slavery or their aftermaths as  they are lived out in the world today” (qtd. in Harris 31). However, as Joseph Har­ ris argues, when Pratt’s idea moves to the classroom, “many students have chosen  to view the contact zone as a kind multicultural bazaar [defined by the voices on  its reading list] which are not so much brought into conflict with opposing views  as placed in a kind of harmless connection with a series of exotic others” (33).  On the other hand, as Harris notes, faculty meetings also engage in the “wran­ gle of competing interests and views,” and their model of interaction is equally  problematic as “exchanges quickly devolved into a kind of position-taking, as the  competing factions on both sides of the issue soon retreated back to and defend­ ed the very arguments they had entered the debate with” (35). Though remaining rather understandably silent on the reform of faculty  meetings, the alternative classroom Harris proposes is a contact zone in which  students “negotiate the gaps and conflicts between several competing discourses”  (31). He builds a case for just such “negotiation” that asks students to articulate  and work through the differences they perceive among themselves as they discuss  books or events (32). When, however, engaged courses move out of the designer  space of a classroom, that zone is even less likely to be limited to general issues  raised by race, gender, and status, or multicultural social theory. As Long’s activ­ ity analysis showed, outside of the classroom students will be acting within the  broader space of a rhetorical situation set in a social, institutional, and commu­ nity setting. The question then becomes, what happens when those students walk into a  collaborative contact zone within the wider activity of engaged education? What  In practice, Handley documents, they “empower(d) citizens with the knowledge of how  the local government worked and the rhetorical skills necessary for leadership in their  community. . . . creat(ing) the conditions for distributed agency in the fight against urban  renewal and restricted housing. . . . By providing a safe space for residents to take control  over their own circumstances. . . . [they] also helped residents establish relationships with  other organizations and individuals outside the community” ( 117). The obvious question  follows: how do our courses stack up? Teaching for Transformation   121 if, as we saw in Chapter 3, their activity analysis must be attuned to a larger insti­ tutional system like a university, or their rhetorical analysis may have to deal with  the current relationship between community members and their organizations?  What if that “attunement” calls for drawing campus organizations, one’s own pro­ fessors, and college administrators into a new, deliberative public? And given that  institution’s norms, expectations, or rules for promotion, what does an activity  analysis mean for an instructor—an untenured assistant professor teaching a 4/4  who chooses the special demands and extra work of an engaged course? Here,  the rhetorical situation for students and teachers isn’t satisfied with a wrangle  over contradictions but calls for a probing rhetorical analysis of how to face those  contradictions, go beyond mere advocacy, and make a difference. Moreover, it  may need to put this collaborative inquiry into writing and into circulation—to  create a public that pays attention. Learning to negotiate such situations will require not just the transfer of writ­ ing skills but expansive and collaborative transformations. Even in familiar writ­ ing projects, the mentor and writer may be separated by not only race or class  but peoples’ aspirations and options for achieving them. And as we saw with the  Decision Makers writers in Chapter 3, the personal relations between Scholar and  Mentor were essential to putting concerns, uncertainty, limitations down on paper  together, whether the issue was as public as a curfew policy or as personal as the  experience of risk and respect. But the collaborative hill to climb isn’t just letting  someone be heard but helping them take on a new, demanding literate practice,  by choice. This creates a challenging contact zone for both parties. Mentors must  create a mutual awareness with their scholar that they are swimming up this new  river together. And that may require taking on a literate practice not merely as a  means to self-expression but putting writing to use in an unfamiliar civic context  to call into being a new local public with one’s words. In the Think Tank cases  we observed in Chapters 2 and 3, literate practices such as collaborative planning  and rivaling supported live interactions and drew writers into creating negotiated  meanings. At the same time, I would say, collaboration was equally motivated and  shaped by the looming presence of a live public performance before peers and  strangers, coupled with the affirming prospect and intimidating expectations of  an actual published, public text. This mix birthed a self-conscious recognition of  being in a contact zone, of the value of difference, and of the need for negotiated  understanding. Learning outcomes like these depend on immersing students as  actors in the multiple dimensions of a live rhetorical problem and its space. More generally, these complex contact zones showcase the way engaged ed­ ucation asks students to draw on rich conceptual frameworks for thinking about  difference, conflict and difficult questions and to then put their current working  hypothesis for negotiating them to the test of experience. When that powerful  mix is coupled with metacognitive awareness of what you did, students are pre­ pared to transform this learning in order to enter new, distinctive, and dynamic  problem spaces. 122   Chapter 6 Becoming a Grounded-Theory Builder Just as choosing to analyze a rhetorical situation as an activity can broaden one’s  outward facing inquiry, grounded-theory building can heighten attunement to  our own interpretations and actions. Working with this framework, students can  begin to see themselves as agents with the power to translate their combination of  course-based conceptual tools and experiential observation into a working theo­ ry—a hypothesis for action, rooted in and waiting to be tested by experience. For  us, this means adapting the researcher’s method of “grounded-practical-theory  building” into a teachable practice designed for students. The Nature of Grounded-Practical-Theory Building (GTB) In their studies of “intellectual discussion in academic institutions,” Robert Craig  and Karen Tracy have translated grounded-theory building from sociology into a  window on communication (248). They have given us a research method designed  not only to describe but, as they argue, to build a normative theory which speaks  directly to practice. Unlike an empirical description of what happened, its goal is a  more prescriptive understanding, not unlike the ethical wisdom of Aristotle’s phro­ nesis. But here is the rub, as Craig and Tracy point out, theories “developed largely  through philosophical speculation may be difficult to operationalize in practice or  have little relevance to the problems and choices that practitioners typically expe­ rience” (250). The alternative, central to John Dewey’s philosophical pragmatism  as well, “envisions critical reflection not as a purely philosophical exercise exter­ nal to practice, but as a process of inquiry that arises within practical situations in  response to practical problems” (253). In grounded-practical-theory building, this  means starting your inquiry at the ground level with people and situations—and  then ferreting out, probing, and naming the problem that calls or spurs you to in­ quiry. Craig and Tracy call researchers to work toward a normative theory. Howev­ er, I will suggest, when the “researchers” are students conducting their own engaged  inquiry, we will want to adapt this powerful process to their lived contexts. Here,  the goal of grounded-theory building will be better described as a hypothesis—a  form of knowing open to experience I would call a “working theory.” Naming the Problem In advocacy work, the problem may be readily apparent, as in contradictions be­ tween what a community or its students need and what its institutions are tooled  up to provide. But as Heifetz’ leadership cases show, our initial or a partisan as­ sessment may not discern the deeper, less obvious problem, especially when that  problem would require us to examine or even alter our own assumptions and  predispositions (e.g., as we saw in the Community Think Tank featured in Chap­ ter 3: aren’t the difficulties of these “Independent” students’ merely a matter of  Teaching for Transformation   123 self-reliance or perhaps merely the indication of low effort?). As the writers in  the hidden frames study of Chapter 4 revealed, the real problem may even be  our own unrecognized marginalizing frames or image of our roles. In another  example, Craig and Tracy’s discourse analysis of troubled faculty communication  practices revealed an ongoing conflict between their “situated ideals” or “incho­ ate normative principles” and the very techniques faculty relied on to address  tensions that framed the problem (250). For instance, consider the difference be­ tween coming to a decision in an unstructured, opinion-airing faculty meeting  or in a deliberative, problem-focused, problem-solving think tank roundtable.  They go on to argue that the real function of a normative ideal may be to work as  a counterfactual model used for “critically reflecting on practice that necessarily  deviates from [this] norm”—that is, the ideal norm you are proposing (253). Yet  it is important to note how in all these cases, actually naming the problem your  theory would address can require research and extended critical inquiry. The Work of Interpretation Naming the problem is the initial step in the extended process of building a theory,  which Paulo Freire describes as praxis or action/reflection. In a problem-oriented  class, this might begin with reading, observation, and discussion as inquiry moves  in a hermeneutic circle of pre-interpretation, action, critical reflection, reinterpre­ tation, and further action. “‘Theory’ (conceptual thought) and ‘practice’ (situated  action) can be understood as moments within this process” (Craig and Tracy 252). In Aristotle’s account, praxis is a way to create practical knowledge or wis­ dom, phronesis. Because this good judgment is often realized in situations of  choice or deliberation, he highlights the role rhetorical skill or techné plays in  the process of discovery. Likewise, in Craig and Tracy’s account of building a  normative model of communication, it takes both rhetorical insight and interac­ tion to build a “rational reconstruction of practice” (248) that is both useful and  a “morally and politically significant social practice” (252). The construction of a  situated, useful normative theory of communication problems, they note, is most  likely to emerge in the interactive discussions we see in “brown bags, seminars  and colloquia and in arguments directed to educators, analysts, organizers” (255).  How, then, shall we draw students in an engaged course beyond mere participa­ tion into this powerful work of interpretation? For this purpose, grounded-theory building (GTB) offers a set of distinctive  moves. It starts not with a topic or much less a claim but with intentional engage­ ment with a problem, a conflict, or a contradiction. And instead of turning to prior  theory or received wisdom, it initiates a problem analysis based on close observa­ tion. It probes not only the context but looks in particular for the strategies, practic­ es, or techniques at play in this communication problem. Here is where GTB goes  beyond standard research, as it seeks to construct an ideal or normative practice.  The aim is practical wisdom, praxis, action. But there is one more twist in the road,  124   Chapter 6 because the ideals articulated in a grounded-practical theory must necessarily be  situated ideals. They are not generalized, abstract principles but a reconstruction  from the data of observation. What they offer is a “reasoned basis for the resolution  of pragmatic dilemmas” (Craig and Tracy 259). Should we do X or Y? In Craig and Tracy’s framework, researchers are the agents and other facul­ ty are the audience. Our task is to adapt it for students in community-engaged  classes in which the challenge is not for educators to create grounded theories  (unless it is about better teaching) but to offer students a new power tool for  transforming their own knowledge guided by a metacognitive awareness of them­ selves as grounded-theory builders. The change would start with a role reversal in  which the students are the researchers to whom we lend support. One approach  to adapting comes out of a comparison Craig and Tracy make to other research.  In one comment, they note many parallels to the early research John R. Hayes  and I did on the cognitive processes of writers, particularly its focus on problems  and close observation. Then, as they point out, since that research doesn’t try to  construct a normative goal, it offers no implications for action. However, I would argue, a more accurate distinction, especially relevant to  teaching, is that those writing studies were motivated by two complementary dis­ ciplinary goals. One was to build a data-based descriptive model of a cognitive  process—a key move in cognitive psychology (Hayes). The other, however, was  to use the observed differences between expert and novice writers as a guide to  identifying and teaching some of the rhetorical problem-solving strategies on  which experienced writers draw (Flower, Problem-Solving). In this sense, we were  indeed reconstructing these observations into situated ideals. However, there is  another important difference. Unlike a normative theory, such strategies are al­ ways heuristics—working hypotheses, merely high-probability moves, designed  to give students a new awareness and conscious control of their own strategic  choices. So the next step in our educational research, I would suggest, is to discov­ er how best to teach this sort of strategic knowledge by observing what learners  actually do with it in practice. In place of a normative theory, we would be work­ ing for a situated hypothesis subject to being tested and developed by experience. Teaching Theory Builders Let us consider an example of a student theory builder trying to make sense  of a no doubt familiar intercultural encounter in a community literacy project.  Keith, a white college mentor, wanted to understand what he called “productive  frictions” within “circuits of power.” He was also trying to minimize his power  position in his relationship with Chandra, an African American teenager (often  amused at his politized reading of her day-to-day life). At the same time, he was  trying to push her to rigorous thinking and to entice her to interrogate her own  assumptions, just as he, a cultural studies student, did. Yet how did Chandra con­ strue this experience and interpret its meaning? For his final paper, Keith was  Teaching for Transformation   125 trying to build a scaffold for teaching about power relations. After documenting  all the instances of the often-subtle shifts in power he observed between teens,  mentors, and adults, his grounded theory was still trying to balance both the flu­ idity of the power dynamics at the CLC with one of his own “foiled attempts” to  shift them. Connecting theory to the world of practice can be difficult. A comparison with his graduate student mentor-coordinator will demon­ strate a more extended practice of theory building that entertains even more de­ manding goals. Starting with a tool I have described as “observation-based theory  building,” this way of conducting research in writing and reading combines the  tools of educational research with the agenda of feminist science. As Donna Har­ away describes the goal of research: “Feminists have to insist on a project . . . that  offers a more adequate, richer, better account of the world, in order to live in it  well (Haraway, qtd. in Flower, “Observation” 167). But Haraway’s agenda also adds two additionally rigorous demands. The first  is an ethical stance to conduct this inquiry “in critical reflexive relation to our  own as well as others’ practices of domination and the unequal part of privilege  and oppression that make up all positions” (167). The second is an epistemologi­ cal stance which recognizes that, since all knowledge is situated knowledge, alter­ native explanations can co-exist. Yet at the same time, this agenda seeks to build  “no-nonsense commitments to faithful accounts of the ‘real world’” that go be­ yond critique—to develop what Donna Haraway would call “feminist objectivity.”  As Sandra Harding puts it, in the place of making personal position statements  much less Truth claims, we are engaged in the rhetorical process of case building  in order to offer “reliable grounds for deciding just which claims to knowledge are  preferable” (qtd. in Flower, “Observation” 167). Here our theory builder Elenore Long (clearly not just any mentor) was using  her dissertation to build just such a “case” by asking, “how do we negotiate inter­ cultural images of literacy?” In a preview of work to come, her observation-based  theory building, like grounded theory, had started with probing and analyzing  this problem, observing on many levels, and recording multiple kinds of data.  And with this observational grounding, she began to forge links with academic  reading, research, and her own intuitions and hypotheses, drawing on conceptual  tools ranging from close analysis, to articulating rival hypotheses, to submitting  her coding to reliability checks and tests of probability. All of which led her back in  turn to the data and new possibilities. In short, she was building a researcher’s ne­ gotiated meaning (Long “The Rhetoric”).3 As an observation-based theory builder,  she was working. on the one hand, to create “a meaningful interpretation of the  3.	  Long’s study, initially subtitled “The Rhetoric of Social Action: College Mentors  Negotiating Intercultural Images of Literacy” appeared in 2000 in Inventing a Discipline  (edited by Maureen Goggin) which traces the formative years of Rhetoric and Compo­ sition as a discipline. What stands out there is the way teaching writing was the dynamic  force in the discipline’s new theory building. 126   Chapter 6 world; and, on the other, to test that constructed reality in clear and careful ways  against the rich and contrary data of experience” (Flower, “Observation” 183).4 It is not surprising that as a graduate student, Elenore Long was acutely aware of  herself as a grounded-theory builder, aware of her methods, and the unknowns she  was working with. Examples of the transformative work that followed have turned  up in previous chapters. But what would it take for an undergraduate mentor to see  this sequence of reading, contact, discussion and writing as pieces of the frame in  their own process of building (rebuilding) a grounded theory? How could a socially  engaged course make them aware of their own agency, taking them beyond a mere  response, into an ongoing process of critical interpretation, to be tested by experi­ ence, then shaped and even transformed in the face of new problems that emerge  (that will perhaps call for new grounded working theories)? Moreover, how do you  lay a foundation for the even more independent work of transformation? Based  on these case studies (as we saw in Chapters 2 and 3) I will argue that one of the  most powerful underlying forces that both instigates and guides transformation is  a student’s metacognitive awareness of what they have learned and its significance.  Such awareness develops naturally over time, but let us consider what we mean by  the term and how our teaching might set this in motion. The Nature of Metacognitive Awareness Imagine for a moment the understanding your own metacognitive awareness might  create in a situation like this. Chad, a Pittsburgh urban teenager, had just written  a forceful argument against his school’s ineffectual suspension practice, with lively  interpolated street language for effect, which would soon be published in one of  the Community Literacy Center’s widely circulated newsletters. His teacher comes  up to you at the public Community Conversation where the teenagers are present­ ing their writing and dramatizing their ideas. In an annoyed, dismissive tone, she  informs you, “You are undoing all my work—telling him that he can write!” How  should you respond? Suppressing your immediate (quite undiplomatic reaction),  you take a mental step back to ask yourself: How should I even interpret this in­ teraction? What is the real problem here? What would the probable effects of al­ ternative emotional, rational, or inquiring responses be? And perhaps later, as you  engage in metacognitive reflection on your own thoughts: Why did I respond the  way I did? Does this information have any implications for my mentoring, teach­ ing, interaction with the schools? How would you respond? To what purpose? 4.	  I would also like to note that the paper quoted here carried a footnote thanking a  number of colleagues whose ideas and voices helped make it. What should be added to  its account of observation-based theory building goes beyond mere appreciation of these  valued individuals to a more sophisticated understanding of the highly significant, con­ structive role a whole network of colleagues plays in shaping and improving any attempt  at theory building. An omission I would like to rectify if I could. Research is a highly  collaborative experience. Teaching for Transformation   127 “Metacognition” like “transfer” is a promiscuous term used for different activ­ ities and multiple levels of consciousness as noted in Chapter 5. In the research on  the regulation of learning, its multiple facets include various metacognitive acts,  from responses at the level of unconscious processing to conscious deliberation  and the regulation of cognition. The unconscious activity kicks in, for instance,  when comprehension of a sentence stumbles and a reader automatically goes  back to reread the problematic sentence. But at the level of conscious observation  and reflection, the reader may pause to ask, “Why is this confusing?” Or the read­ er may draw on a strategy, like recalling the context; or may consider a plan to  solve the dilemma, such as asking in class; or may go so far as to notice how their  own speed-reading practice may not be working so well here. And some readers  may make the even more demanding cognitive move of drawing a connecting  inference or venturing an explanation for this experience (e.g., is this problem  with me or something about this text?). The examples of transformation in this  book are chosen to reflect this higher-level metacognitive work. As we saw in the  cases, metacognition might take the form of a focused memory search, probing  one’s thinking, assumptions, and experiences; and it can even rise to articulating  not only remembered events, but the feelings and judgments they engendered.  As in my encounter with that high school teacher, this can allow a more revealing  comparison of one’s initial cognitive and affective response to one’s own current  interpretation. Metacognition can stage an internal mental drama. In rhetoric and composition, we assign reflection for many purposes, from  prompting a review of assigned readings to revising one’s own writing. For our  purposes, I wish to focus on a distinctive form of reflection designed to support  that higher level of metacognitive awareness that feeds and invites transforma­ tion. Given that engaged education, by its very nature, seeks to adapt to its setting,  I cannot presume to offer the practices, much less curriculum, that might be best  for yours. For example, prompting such reflection is itself a very opportunistic  move: it can happen in a conversation walking down the hall, in a debriefing, or  in dedicated class discussions on the formal assignments as described in Chapter  5. More importantly, although this book does offer descriptions of some practic­ es I and others have worked with, that may or may not be suited to your goals.  However, we can look at our own assignments, practices, and goals to gauge how  directly they support students’ own awareness. And to note how we do it: through  invitation, modeling, scaffolding . . . ? Three Tests for Teaching Metacognitive Awareness Like activity analysis, grounded-theory building is a rhetorical theory and a prac­ tice we are likely to be good at teaching, focused as it is on observing, naming and  interpreting a live and present problem. Metacognition is the next step to actually  becoming a theory builder. However, this power tool is a highly individual, inter­ nal action—a form of awareness that is hard to model or observe. So I would like  128   Chapter 6 to conclude this chapter, first by sketching a set of tests teachers can use to ask:  do I see any evidence that my students are building bridges, seeing applications,  and making change. And secondly, to offer a Guide for students to help them ask  these critical questions for themselves, in a collaborative inquiry with others. 1. The Bridge test. How does a given practice (in a course or on site) help students build bridges that  go from their academic/intellectual work to their experiential realities and then  to reflective interpretations? Have they been able to articulate the connections,  the disjunctions, the contradictions, insights, the opportunities that drawing  these inferences can reveal? Bear in mind, building real bridges takes time, tools,  and effort. 2. The Application test. Many of the passionately held ideas we have discussed here—from philosophical  pragmatism, engaged education, public deliberation, community engaged writing  and rhetoric to building grounded theories—have at their core concerns for social  action, interaction, being useful, making change, and their consequences. But in  the humanities, school is not always designed to teach, promote, track or some­ times even care about the application and outcomes of what students learned. So,  we might ask whether or not our given educational practice is asking students to go  beyond the experience of being immersed in an activity to consider an application  of what they have learned beyond this horizon. Notice, as a foundation for trans­ forming knowledge, this is asking what they have taught themselves. As we have  seen in Chapters 2 and 5, for some students the new application turned up in other  courses, in their professional plans as a writer, engineer, economist, or in decisions  in family business. For others it informed their role in other community connec­ tions, in political or social activism, even in their sense of identity. An educational practice supporting application would invite students to ex­ tend that bridge built from theory, to experience, to reflective interpretation, on  out into the unknown. However, these are still students, in a course, not review­ ing options in the career planning office. This educational practice calls, first, for  real thinking, uncovering applications of an idea, drawing inferences, seeing the  connection to problems, imagination. It is genuinely constructive work. And sec­ ondly, to go beyond a thought exercise, as useful as one may be, in Chapter 4 we  saw students using a written reflection on their current application of these ideas  to raise consciousness of applying learning as an immediate, self-conscious move.  It had never occurred to Justine—Chapter 4—that teaching argument involved  more than adversarial debate. The test here is whether a given teaching practice  is supporting a new metacognitive awareness of the choices a given application  entails for themselves and others, the assumptions they are working from, and  the consequences of acting. Teaching for Transformation   129 3. The Discovery and Change Test This attention to application has an equally distinguished background in both rhet­ oric and liberatory education. One of the founding voices of contemporary rhetoric  and composition, Richard E. Young, captured this approach with his book title:  Rhetoric: Discovery and Change. Unlike classical studies or communication’s focus  on argument or persuasion, this rhetoric reimagined the ancient art of Invention,  which put the art of meaning making at the heart of what writers do. In doing so it  celebrated the power of writing itself as first of all an act of discovery for the writer.  How then do our students perceive their own acts of written meaning making, be­ yond the production of a text? Are they thinking about their thinking? I am (well, was) in fact working out what I wanted to I mean here while walking  down a deeply wooded trail, stopping to jot down alternative sentence bits on this  scrap of paper, all the while attending to the sheer exuberance of low spring plants,  shaded by towering trees, sheltering some insistently courting bird calls around me.  And in the next instant, I began attending to the steady stream of ideas, connec­ tions, memories, and all the words that began to pop up as fresh possibilities that  could create or support (somehow, but just how exactly?) this idea of “Discovery  and Change.” Soon I was also thinking about thinking, about how all this was being  brought into consciousness, to be worked with, by that willful act of writing. (And I  should note, words to be again revised as I finish this manuscript.) Pace Coleridge’s myth of inspiration, I would not say, even in this meditative  space, that all this rose up before me “with a parallel production of correspondent  expression, without any sensation or consciousness of effort.”5 This is not to say  that inspiration isn’t real and amazingly productive, but it is unlikely to do the  work we have in mind that can actually build bridges into unknown territory and  construct the inferences that envision and test their applications. Rather than  merely putting an intact meaning into words, this kind of writing is often an ex­ tended constructive process of figuring out what inchoate felt connections could  actually mean, drawing new inferences, challenging old ones, testing it against  the words we do have. And it helps to realize all this is a normal process. Let me shift to another discourse (often a revealing tool for invention). In  teaching for metacognitive awareness, we are inviting students to turn their yet- to-be-connected pockets of “knowing” into an articulated form. That will include  first exploring disparate parts of one’s memory networks (some salient or acces­ sible, some not), then translating multiple mental representations (some visual,  others affective, propositional, as well as linguistic) into words. And the language  itself may still be writer-based, ill-considered, or vague, lacking the nuanced com­ plexity of a sophisticated representation (Flower, “Images”). And as expert/nov­ ice studies suggest, experienced writers go well beyond an expressive utterance  to building an actively negotiated meaning (Flower, Construction; Writer-Based). 5.	  This account of composing Kubla Khan turned out, in fact, to be quite fictitious. 130   Chapter 6 Echoing the value of awareness, Paulo Freire’s liberatory “problem-posing ed­ ucation” describes the central goal as achieving “critical consciousness”—learn­ ing to perceive social contradictions and take action against oppression (19). And  like Richard Young, in the test he proposes learners would combine the rhetoric  of articulated discovery with metacognitive awareness to carry out the purpose­ ful work of change. As Freire puts it, “to exist, humanly, is to name the world, to  change it. Once named, the world in its turn reappears to the namers as a problem  and requires of them a new naming. Men are not built in silence, but in word, in  work, in action-reflection” (88). This test looks at our students’ metacognitive awareness of their own writing as a  process of Discovery and Change. Such an agenda adapts grounded observation and  theory building for an explicit purpose—for action, for making change, and for the  pragmatist’s search for outcomes. The consequential vision of John Dewey and the  prophetic pragmatism of Cornel West that shaped my understanding of intercultur­ al inquiry speak directly to this larger project of locating the educational power of  community engagement in its outcomes (Flower, Community). Dewey would move  us from forming hypotheses to the ongoing critical search which locates the mean­ ing of this hypothesis in outcomes. The value of our conceptions is determined “by  the consequences they effect in existence as it is perceptibly experienced” (Quest  132). West adds the ethical imperative to probe experiential consequences for the  most marginalized. This interaction is eloquently captured by Rachel Shah: “West’s  deep and soulful stance against injustice adds a necessary analysis of power to Dew­ ey’s emphasis on experiential knowledge, antifoundational questioning, and feet-on- the-ground commitment to action” (17). I would ask, are my students aware of the  power of or reflecting on their own process of “discovery and change.” Supporting Grounded-Theory Actors As a teacher I have found these three tests of engaged education helpful. But at this  point it is appropriate to turn the inquiry over to students: to shift from the tests  of our curriculum to students’ reflection on their own in-process theory building  and its bridge to action. As people become self-conscious agents of their own  learning, the opportunity to compare their developing understanding and uncer­ tainties with one another can open up both possibilities and useful problems. The  following collaborative tool is written for students to use to test their own prog­ ress in the same three curriculum areas we have been considering above: building  bridges, envisioning applications, and linking discovery to change. The questions  are designed to help them prepare for a more in-depth discussion with colleagues  (in the class and community) of their problem-oriented “theory-in-progress.”6 6.	  The notion of sharing our thinking, hypotheses, learning with our community  partners is an important step from service to collaboration. One of the best, and very  grounded, guides to this is found in Rachael Shah’s Rewriting Partnerships. Teaching for Transformation   131 What Is Your Grounded Theory Saying Today?  A Preparation for Making Thinking Visible As a grounded-theory builder, use these questions to prepare for a collab­ orative discussion by asking yourself, “How would I explain this to myself,  or to someone else who asks me to.” As a Collaborative Planning Partner in  the role of Supporter, prepare to ask these probing questions and help your  Partner take the inquiry deeper. 1. Entering into Engagement 1.	 Community engaged courses take people into a new world and an  unfamiliar, complex activity system. How would you compare what  you expected to what you found? 2.	 You probably ran into or noticed a couple of problems. How did you  interpret them? 3.	 How did you respond? 4.	 So, what did you conclude or learn from that experience? 5.	 Can you think of any rivals to how you named the problem or chose  to act? 2. Reading the Situation 1.	 Whenever writing or speaking is involved, you are in a rhetorical sit­ uation. How did you read the rhetorical situation you found yourself  in, especially when you looked at it as part of a larger activity? 2.	 Did you have to interact with any institutions, traditions, or rules?  How so? 3.	 Were you aware of the roles you and other people were supposed to  play? Or of your place in a hierarchy with relations based on status or  power? How did you respond to that situation? 4.	 Did you ever need to switch from one Discourse to another? If you weren’t  already an “insider” in one of those Discourses, how did you respond? 5.	 Did you find yourself drawing on any particularly useful tools? They  could be material ones, such as technology, scheduled planning ses­ sions, taking notes. Or conceptual ones, such as taking an inquiry  stance in an intercultural contact zone, deliberately seeking out rival  hypotheses, or methods you have learned for political, social, cultur­ al, or cognitive analysis. 6.	 Activity systems are usually full of buried contradictions and ill-de­ fined conflicts. As these areas are often the best sites for change, did  you uncover any? 7.	 How did you define the problem—and its rivals? 132   Chapter 6 8.	 What did you do in response (ignore it, describe it, discuss it, propose  action, imagine consequences, or act)? 3. Collaborating in a Contact Zone 1.	 Community engagement will put us in contact with some significant  differences. Thinking of your community partner, what have been  the two or three most important differences for you? Don’t rest with  obvious ones like race, gender, orientation . . . Also consider barriers  such as background, attitudes, assumptions, goals, and valuable dif­ ferences in experiential knowledge, insight, and skills. 2.	 Was there something you had to work on together where these differ­ ences could matter? How so? Were they surprising, confusing, prob­ lematic, useful? 3.	 When you tried to collaborate and needed to negotiate your differ­ ences, did you hit a problem? How did you try to deal with it? And if  you successfully worked something out, how did you do so? 4.	 What would you say you learned? 4. Becoming a Grounded-Theory Actor 1.	 Back when you first compared what you expected with what you  found, you started building a personal interpretation or “theory” of the  situation. As you moved to building your own more in-depth, practical  grounded theory, what did you decide to focus on or try to understand? 2.	 More specifically, how would you define the meaningful problem  with which you hope to engage? Think of it as a revealing conflict  or one of those contradictions that frequently occur between two as­ sumptions, practices, or forces that make a difference. 3.	 How many ways (tools) have you found to closely observe and docu­ ment this problem in action? 4.	 What are some rival interpretations you have considered? And what  are the consequences those ways of seeing your problem might have  in this situation? 5.	 When you consider ways to respond to your problem, how would you  meet the demands for a morally, socially, or politically significant practice? 6.	 Does your response name explicit, practical strategies for change? 7.	 Effective grounded-practical-theory builders are also observing and  reflecting on their own learning and thinking, on their growing rep­ ertoire of strategies, and on their ways of dealing with conflict. Look­ ing back at your own thinking in this project so far, what problems  did you encounter, and what have you taught yourself? 8.	 So, what will you do now? 133 Works Cited Adler-Kassner, Linda. “Because Writing is Never Just Writing.” College Composition  and Communication, vol. 69, no. 2, 2017, pp. 317-340.

Drawing on 20 years of data to document the significant outcomes  such experiences have had for college students in their lives—up to ten  years later—Linda Flower reveals a critical distinction between transfer  and the transformation of knowledge. Each chapter embeds its methods in  a set of case studies modeling the methods and reflecting on the findings  emerging from its use. The result is a book that considers how we as teachers  can draw our students into this inquiry and help them develop a more  articulate awareness of their experiential knowledge, choices, and agency.  Linda Flower is Professor Emerita of English at Carnegie Mellon University.  She is the author of numerous articles and chapters in edited collections as well  as the books Problem-Solving Strategies for Writing in College and Community,  The Construction of Negotiated Meaning, and Community Literacy and the  Rhetoric of Public Engagement. She is the recipient of the National Council of  Teachers of English James Squire Award, which honors “outstanding service,  not only to the stature and development of NCTE and the discipline which it  represents, but also to the profession of education as a whole, internationally  as well as nationally.” Practices & Possibilities Series Editors: Aimee McClure, Kelly Ritter, Aleashia Walton, and Jagadish Paudel The WAC Clearinghouse Fort Collins, CO 80523 wac.colostate.edu University Press of Colorado Denver, Colorado 80202 upcolorado.com ISBN 978-1-64215-238-8 W
