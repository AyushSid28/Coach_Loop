Many of the Playfair facilitators who have been trained  in the models presented here have achieved fabulous results with  their clients, helping their interactions come alive with fun,  originality and innovation. Highly recommended!” —Matt Weinstein,  founder, Playfair Inc, and author, Managing To Have Fun “In the field of international development, managing participatory  decision-making among people from diverse backgrounds and  cultures is a necessity not an option.  Our organization employs a  staff of several thousand who touch the lives of hundreds of  millions of people living in poverty, in developing nations across  the globe.  As we build our capacity to convene and facilitate  multi-stakeholder processes, we have found Sam Kaner’s book and  his teachings to be immensely beneficial.  I strongly recommend   Facilitator’s Guide to Participatory Decision-Making to anyone who  wants a deeper appreciation of the skills required to build  sustainable agreements.” —Jamie Watts,  Institutional Learning and Change, Bioversity International,  Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research,  Rome, Italy PRAISE FOR THIS REMARKABLE BOOK! PRAISE FOR THIS REMARKABLE BOOK! i “Sam Kaner is one of the world’s leading experts on collaboration.  His grasp of the challenges and dilemmas of collaboration is  superb, as are his models and methods for facilitating complex  processes.  The second edition of this widely-used book reflects his  accumulated wisdom and teachings.  Clearly written and  wonderfully illlustrated, this book makes difficult issues  understandable and provides sound, practical guidance.” —Sandy Schuman, editor, Creating a Culture of Collaboration  and founding editor, Group Facilitation: A Research and Applications  Journal “Facilitator’s Guide to Participatory Decision-Making is an  outstanding resource for tackling complex community and  business challenges.  We have used it for strategic planning in our  nationally recognized child welfare programs and in our  innovative programs to end homelessness.  The second edition  adds many helpful process management tools, and the new  material on difficult dynamics is brilliant.  I keep a copy on my  desk for easy reference.” —Roxane White, CEO, Denver Department of Human Services “When I first heard about participatory decision-making, my  reaction was that it sounded like a nice idea but I didn’t see its  relevance for my role as a leader and CEO.  After seeing Sam Kaner  and his colleagues facilitate so effectively in many different high- stake contexts, I have completely changed my mind.  I now  recognize that a highly participatory approach is often the most  effective way to develop and drive strategy, particularly when   dealing with complex problems with highly diverse participants.        Reading Facilitator’s Guide was an ‘aha’ experience for me; it  described the group dynamics that had previously been  mysterious, and it showed me how to work with them effectively.   Kaner’s decision-making procedures are the best I’ve ever seen.   At Goodwill, we use them all the time.  The new edition gives us  several more valuable tools to be effective at making decisions.   For anyone who values collaboration and wants to put its guiding  principles into practice, the book is a must-read!” —Deborah Alvarez-Rodriguez, president and CEO, Goodwill  Industries of San Francisco, San Mateo and Marin Counties ii   “In my opinion, Facilitator’s Guide to Participatory Decision-Making  is the best book on collaboration ever written.  I say this as  someone who has been a CEO or executive director for more than  20 years.  During that time I have worked with countless  facilitators and organization development consultants.  For depth  of impact and overall effectiveness, Sam Kaner and his colleagues  are top-of-the-line.  This book is loaded with the tools and guiding  principles that make Sam’s work so compelling.” —Diane Flannery, founding CEO, Juma Ventures, and director,  Global Center for Children and Families, UCLA, Semel Institute “Sam Kaner and his team have helped me create a culture of  collaboration in science.  This is no easy task!  Twenty-five years  ago I started with nothing.  Now my organization has the  potential to make a large impact by discovering causes of the most  devastating diseases that affect children.  Sam’s superb skills in  strategic thinking and group facilitation, and his deep expertise in  organization design and systems change have been essential for  our success.  In Facilitator’s Guide to Participatory Decision-Making,  Sam and his team translate their own learnings from many  different kinds of work environments into concrete techniques  that will benefit business, government and non-profits alike.” — John Harris,  founder and CEO, California Birth Defects Monitoring Program,  California Department of Health Services “Facilitator’s Guide gives readers tools and insights to enable  effective participatory action and the potential to achieve strong  principled results and positive social change.” — Michael Doyle, author, How to Make Meetings Work   “I am a longtime client and colleague of Community At Work.  They are extraordinarily talented at facilitating effective teams and  teaching others to do the same.  Their consulting approach creates  lasting solutions by promoting organizational health through  collaborative working relationships.  Facilitator’s Guide reveals and  explains many of their most compelling methods and practices.” —Ed Pierce, founder and CEO, Leadership Quality Inc. iii “Facilitator’s Guide takes the mystery and fear out of facilitating  groups and provides useful tools for anyone working with groups.   The materials are clear.  The graphics are first rate.  And complex  issues are developed logically and with great care.” —Thomas Broitman, managing director,  Executive Education, PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP “This book is a must for anyone working with a team!  It is loaded  with new information, which will make your team facilitation and  decision-making even better.  It highlights key concepts underlying  group process that are rarely defined in such a clear manner.  And,  at the same time, it provides easy-to-follow facilitation techniques  to ensure group participation and convergence around decisions  and ideas.  This is a book that rarely stays on my shelf- I’m too busy  using it as a reference.  Truly a golden nugget in the vast pool of  facilitation knowledge!” —Tammy Adams, author, Facilitating the Project Lifecycle “What a practical, sensible guide for helping groups work together  in a realistic way!  The graphics help you visualize how to manage  many common – and puzzling – aspects of group behavior.” —Marvin Weisbord, consultant and author, Productive Workplaces  and co-author, Discovering Common Ground and Future Search “Marshall Medical Center is community based, and we have always  valued a culture of participation. We frequently make inclusive  decisions allowing buy-in to difficult actions we need to take as an  organization. Using Facilitator’s Guide to Participatory Decision- Making and working with Sarah Fisk has helped us to maintain and  even increase participation while still making timely decisions.   Rather than simply relying on Sarah, who is a true genius at  facilitation, this book has allowed us to build our own capacity.   We've learned how to convene multiple stakeholder teams, plan  effectively, and make more sustainable decisions, thus maintaining  our collaborative values as we grow to serve a wider community.  I  highly recommend this book.” —James Whipple, CEO,  Marshall Medical Center, El Dorado County, California iv     John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Facilitative behaviors and skills are essential for anyone who  wants to work collaboratively in groups and organizations  today.  Facilitative skills honor, enhance, and focus the wisdom  and knowledge that lay dormant in most groups.  These skills  are essential to healthy organizations, esprit de corps, fair and  lasting agreements, and to easily implement actions and plans. Sam Kaner and the team from Community At Work have been  developing and articulating these tools to further democratic  action and to enable people from all walks of life to work  together in more constructive and productive ways.  The  Facilitator’s Guide to Participatory Decision-Making will give  readers additional tools and insights to enable effective,  participatory action and the potential to achieve strong,  principled results and positive social change.  Anyone wanting  to increase their understanding of group dynamics and improve  their skill at making groups work more effectively will benefit  from this valuable book. The Purpose of Group Facilitation Those who work with and lead organizations today have  learned two lasting lessons in the last twenty-five years of  concerted action research in this field of organization  development and change.  Lesson one:  if people don’t  participate in and “own” the solution to the problems or agree  to the decision, implementation will be half-hearted at best,  probably misunderstood, and, more likely than not, will fail. FOREWORD to the First Edition FOREWORD to the First Edition xi By Michael Doyle By Michael Doyle The second lesson is that the key differentiating factor in the  success of an organization is not just the products and services,  not just its technology or market share, but the organization’s  ability to elicit, harness, and focus the vast intellectual capital  and goodwill resident in their members, employees, and  stakeholders.  When that intellectual capital and goodwill get  energized and focused, the organization becomes a powerful  force for positive change in today’s business and societal  environments.  Applying these two lessons has become a key  element of what we have begun to think of as the learning  organization. How do leaders and their organizations apply these two lessons?  By creating psychologically safe and involving group  environments where people can identify and solve problems,  plan together, make collaborative decisions, resolve their own  conflicts, trouble-shoot, and self-manage as responsible adults.  Facilitation enables the organization’s teams, groups and  meetings to be much more productive.  And the side benefits of  facilitated or self-facilitated groups are terrific:  a sense of  empowerment, a deepening of personal commitment to  decisions and plans, increased organizational loyalty, and the  building of esprit de corps. Nowhere are these two lessons put more into practice than in  groups.  The world meets a lot.  The statistics are staggering.  There are over 25 million meetings every day in the United  States and over 85 million worldwide.  Making both our work  groups and civic groups work much more effectively is a  lifelong challenge as rich as the personalities that people them.   Thus, what I call “group literacy” – an awareness of and strong  skills in group dynamics, meeting facilitation and consensus  building tools like the ones in this book – is essential to  increasing the effectiveness of group meetings.  They enable  groups to work smarter, harder, deeper, and faster.  These tools  help build healthier groups, organizations, and communities.  Facilitative mind-sets, behaviors, and tools are some of the  essential ingredients of high-commitment/high-performance  organizations.  They are critical to making real what we’ve come  to think of as the learning organization.  These skills and  behaviors are aligned with people’s higher selves.  People  naturally want to learn them in order to increase their own  personal effectiveness in groups and in their families as well as  to increase the effectiveness of groups themselves. xii   A Partial History of Group Facilitation The concept of facilitation and facilitators is as old as the tribes.  Alaskan natives report of this kind of role in ancient times.  As a  society we’re starting to come full circle – from the circle of the  tribe around the fire, to the pyramidal structures of the last  3,000 years, back to the ecology of the circle, flat pyramids, and  networks of today’s organizations.  The philosophy, mind-set,  and skills of facilitation have much in common with the  approaches used by Quakers, Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr.,  and people in nonviolence movements over the centuries.   More recently these include the civil rights movement,  women’s consciousness-raising groups, some parts of the  environmental movement, and citizen involvement groups that  started in the 1960s and 1970s.  Meeting facilitation started to appear as a formal process in the  late 1960s and early 1970s and had become widespread by the  late 1980s.  Its proponents advocated it as a tool to assist people  to become the architects of their own future.  It evolved from  the role of learning facilitators that emerged in the early 1960s.  In learning or encounter groups, the facilitator’s focus was on  building awareness and enabling learning.  These learning/  awareness facilitators played key roles in the nascent human  potential movement and the women’s consciousness-raising  movement and continue to do so in today’s version of lifelong  learning situations where learning is seen as a dialogue rather  than a rote process.  Its pragmatic roots also include cognitive  science, information processing theory, sociology, psychology,  community organizing, arbitration and mediation principles,  and experience.  Task-oriented group facilitation evolved out of the societal  milieu of the last thirty years, especially in industrial and  information-rich societies where time is a key factor.  We  needed to find methods for people to work together more  effectively.  Quality circle groups, cross-functional task forces,  and civic groups were the early big users and advocates of this  methodology.  Facilitation was an informal, flexible alternative  to the constricting format of parliamentary procedure and  Robert’s Rules of Order.  Group facilitation was also an approach  that was proactive, solving conflicts before they arose, as well as  one that could handle multiple constituencies.  It was a viable  alternative to mediation-style approaches.  Once participants in  a learning group or consciousness-raising group raised their xiii awareness, they wanted to take action.  There was an expressed  need to put their new insights and knowledge to work – to take  actions, solve problems, plan, and make group decisions.  Thus  the role of the task-oriented facilitator evolved to serve these  needs as well as the new approaches to organizational change  and renewal that were developing in the early 1970s.  As two of the cofounders of meeting facilitation, David Straus  and I were interested in giving people tools to architect their  own more powerful futures.  That meant giving them  frameworks and tools to make the groups they worked and lived  with much more effective, powerful, and productive.  We saw  group facilitation as both a social contract and a new, content  neutral role – a more formalized third party role in groups.  We  articulated the difference and power between “content” and  “process” neutrality.  Content neutrality means not taking a  position on the issues at hand; not having a position or a stake  in the outcome.  Process neutrality means not advocating for  certain kinds of processes such as brainstorming.  We found  that the power in the role of the facilitator was in becoming  content neutral and a process advocate – advocating for fair,  inclusive, and open processes that would balance participation  and improve productivity while establishing a safe  psychological space in which all group members could fully  participate. The role of the facilitator was designed to help minimize wheel  spinning and dysfunctional dynamics and to enable groups to  work together much more effectively.  Other key pioneers of  facilitation in the 1970s were Geoff Ball and David Sibbet with  their seminal work in graphic recording and graphic  facilitation.  The core concepts and tools of group facilitation  seemed to grow out of the tight-knit organization development  and training community in the San Francisco Bay Area in the  1970s and ’80s.  It is great to see Sam Kaner and his colleagues  continuing this rich legacy of theory and skill building. Researchers at the Institute for the Future postulate that it takes  about thirty years for social inventions to become widespread.   Group facilitation is one such social invention.  Over these last  twenty-five years, facilitation skills have spread widely in the  United States and are being spread around the world.  And now,   organizations are coming full circle to where facilitators once  again are being utilized in learning organizations to facilitate  dialogue processes that surface deep assumptions and mental xiv   models about how we view our world.  These existing mental  models are often the underlying sources of our conflict and  dysfunction.  By surfacing, examining, and changing them, we  are able to work together in new ways to build new systems  thinking models that assist groups in articulating their core  values and beliefs.  These new mental models serve as the  foundation for organizations as they evolve, grow, and  transform themselves to meet the challenges of the next  century. Expanding Definitions of Facilitation These skills have become so useful in organizations that they  have spread beyond the role of facilitator:  to facilitative leaders;  to self-facilitative groups and teams; to facilitative individuals  and even facilitative, user-friendly procedures.  Facilitation has  become part of our everyday language.  The Latin root of  facilitate means “to enable, to make easy.”  Facilitation has  evolved to have a number of meanings today. A facilitative individual is an individual who is easy to work  with, a team player, a person aware of individual and group  dynamics.  He or she assists colleagues to work together more  effectively.  A facilitative individual is a person who is skilled  and knowledgeable in the interpersonal skills of  communication, collaborative problem solving and planning,  consensus building, and conflict resolution.  A facilitator is an individual who enables groups and  organizations to work more effectively; to collaborate and  achieve synergy.  She or he is a “content-neutral” party who by  not taking sides or expressing or advocating a point of view  during the meeting, can advocate for fair, open, and inclusive  procedures to accomplish the group’s work.  A facilitator can  also be a learning or a dialogue guide to assist a group in  thinking deeply about its assumptions, beliefs, and values and  about its systemic processes and context. A facilitative leader is a leader who is aware of group and  organizational dynamics; a leader who creates organization- wide involvement processes that enable members of the  organization to more fully utilize their potential and gifts in  order to help the organization articulate and achieve its vision  and goals, while at the same time actualizing its spoken values.   xv Facilitative leaders often understand the inherent dynamics  between facilitating and leading and frequently utilize  facilitators in their organizations.  A facilitative group (team, task force, committee, or board) is  one in which facilitative mind-sets and behaviors are widely  distributed among the members; a group that is minimally  dysfunctional and works very well together; a group that is easy  to join and works well with other groups and individuals.  I think you, the reader, will find this book very useful for your  work in groups, whether you are a leader, a group member, or a  facilitator.  I especially recommend to you the insightful  chapters on understanding group dynamics, facilitative  listening, and the importance of values.  Where this book also  makes a real contribution is in the chapters on reaching closure  and the gradients of an agreement.  I enjoyed the learnings and  insights I received from this book, and I am sure you will too. Michael Doyle San Francisco, California March 1996 xvi INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION The benefits of group decision-making have been widely  publicized:  better thinking, better “buy-in,” better decisions all  around.  Yet the promise often fails to materialize.  Many  decisions made in groups are neither thoughtful nor inclusive;  they are unimaginative, watered-down mediocrities.  Why is this so?  To a large degree, the answer is deeply rooted in prevailing  cultural values that make it difficult for people to actually think  in groups.  Without even realizing it, many people make value  judgments that inhibit spontaneity and deter others from  saying what is really on their minds.  For example, ideas that  are expressed in clumsy ways, or in tentative terms, are often  treated as if they were decidedly inferior to ideas that are  presented with eloquent rhetorical flourish.  Efforts at exploring  complexities are discouraged, in favor of pithy judgments and  firm-sounding conclusions.  Making action plans – no matter  how unrealistic they might be – is called “getting something  done,” while analyzing the underlying causes of a problem is  called “going off on a tangent.”  Mixed messages abound:  speak  your mind but don’t ask too many questions; be passionate but  don’t show your feelings; be productive but hurry up – and get  it right the first time.  All in all, conventional values do not  promote effective thinking in groups.   Yet, when it’s done well, group decision-making remains the  best hope for solving difficult problems.  There is no substitute  for the wisdom that results from a successful integration of  divergent points of view.  Successful group decision-making  requires a group to take advantage of the full range of  experience and skills that reside in its membership.  This means  encouraging people to speak up.  It means inviting difference,  not fearing it.  It means struggling to understand one another,  especially in the face of the pressures and contradictions that  typically drive group members to shut down.  In short, it means  operating from participatory values.   Participatory and conventional approaches to group decision- making yield entirely different group norms.  Some of the  differences are presented in the table on the next page. xvii  xiv   PARTICIPATORY GROUPS CONVENTIONAL GROUPS People are able to listen to each other’s  ideas because they know their own ideas will  also be heard. Each member speaks up on matters of  controversy.  Everyone knows where  everyone stands. People give each other room to think and get  their thoughts all the way out. People refrain from talking behind each  other’s backs. Even in the face of opposition from the  person-in-charge, people are encouraged  to stand up for their beliefs. Members can accurately represent each  other’s points of view – even when they  don’t agree with them. Each member makes the effort to pay  attention to the person speaking. Everyone participates, not just the vocal few. Opposing viewpoints are allowed to co-exist  in the room. People draw each other out with supportive  questions.  “Is this what you mean?” A problem is not considered solved until  everyone who will be affected by the  solution understands the reasoning. When people make an agreement, it is  assumed that the decision still reflects a  wide range of perspectives. People have difficulty listening to each other’s  ideas because they’re busy rehearsing what  they want to say. Some members remain quiet on controversial  matters.  No one really knows where  everyone stands. People interrupt each other on a regular basis. Because they don’t feel permission to be direct  during the meeting, people talk behind each  other’s backs outside the meeting. People with discordant, minority perspectives  are commonly discouraged from speaking out. People rarely give accurate representations of  the opinions and reasoning of those whose  opinions are at odds with their own. Unless the speaker captivates their attention,  people space out, doodle or check the clock. The fastest thinkers and most articulate  speakers get more air time. Differences of opinion are treated as conflict  that must either be stifled or “solved.” Questions are often perceived as challenges,  as if the person being questioned has done  something wrong. A problem is considered solved as soon as the fastest thinkers have reached an answer.   Everyone else is then expected to “get on  board” regardless of whether s/he understands  the logic of the decision. When people make an agreement, it is  assumed that they are all thinking the exact  same thing.  xviii  As the table implies, a shift from conventional values to  participatory values is not a simple matter of saying, “Let’s  become a thinking team.”  It requires a change of mindset  – a committed effort from a group to swim against the tide of  prevailing values and assumptions.   When a group undertakes this challenge, its participants often  benefit from the services a competent facilitator can provide for  them.  Left to their own devices, many groups would slip back  into conventional habits.  A facilitator, however, has the skills  to help a group outgrow their old familiar patterns.  Specifically,  the facilitator encourages full participation, s/he promotes  mutual understanding, s/he fosters inclusive solutions and s/he  cultivates shared responsibility.  These four functions (discussed  in depth in chapter 3) are derived from the core values of  participatory decision-making.  Putting Participatory Values Into Practice The facilitator is the keeper of the flame, the carrier of the  vision of what Michael Doyle described, in his foreword, as “a  fair, inclusive and open process.”  This is why many facilitators  help their groups to understand the dynamics and values of  group decision-making.  They recognize that it is empowering  for participants to acquire common language and shared points  of reference about their decision-making processes.   When a facilitator helps group members acquire process skills,  s/he is acting in congruence with one of the core values of  participatory decision-making:  shared responsibility.  This  value played a prominent role in the design of The Facilitator’s  Guide to Participatory Decision-Making.  It was written as a series  of stand-alone pages that facilitators can photocopy and  distribute to the members of their groups.  For example, newly  forming groups often benefit from reading and discussing  chapters 1 and 2.  These pages take less than fifteen minutes to  read; they are entertaining; and they provide the basis for  meaningful conversations about the dynamics and values of  participatory decision-making.  Within the guidelines of the  policy statement on photocopying (see page 313), feel free to  reproduce any part of this book that will strengthen your  group’s capacity for reaching sustainable agreements. xix Facilitating Sustainable Agreements The process of building a sustainable agreement has four stages:   gathering diverse points of view; building a shared framework  of understanding; developing inclusive solutions; and reaching  closure.  A competent facilitator knows how to move a group  from start to finish through those stages.  To do so, s/he needs    a conceptual understanding of the dynamics and values of  participatory decision-making (as provided in Part I of this  book).  S/he also needs a standard set of process management  skills (as provided in Part II).  And s/he needs a repertoire of  sophisticated thinking tools, to propose and conduct stage- specific interventions (as provided in Part III and Part IV).    Fulfilling The Promise of Group Decision-Making Those who practice participatory methods often come to see  that facilitating a meeting is more than merely an occasion for  solving a problem or creating a plan.  It is also an opportunity  to support profound personal learning, and it is an opportunity  to strengthen the capacity and effectiveness of the group as a  whole.  These opportunities are only realizable – the promise of  group decision-making can only be fulfilled – through the  struggle and the satisfaction of putting participatory values   into practice.   xx  GROUNDING PRINCIPLES GROUNDING PRINCIPLES Part One   3 IDEALIZED AND REALISTIC MODELS OF  COLLABORATION IN GROUPS ➧  Misunderstandings About the  Process of Group Decision-Making ➧  The Struggle to Integrate Diverse  Perspectives ➧  The Diamond of Participatory  Decision-Making THE DYNAMICS OF GROUP DECISION-MAKING11    Community At Work  © 2007   4   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    This picture portrays a hypothetical problem-solving discussion. Each circle –      – represents one idea.  Each line of circles-and-arrows  represents one person’s line of thought as it develops during the discussion. As diagrammed, everyone appears to be tracking each other’s ideas, everyone  goes at the same pace, and everyone stays on board every step of the way. A depressingly large percentage of people who work in groups believe this  stuff.  They think this picture realistically portrays a healthy, flowing  decision-making process.  And when their actual experience doesn’t match  up with this model, they think it’s because their own group is defective.   If people actually behaved as the diagram suggests, group decision-making  would be much less frustrating.  Unfortunately, real-life groups don’t operate  this way. ✔ DECISION POINT NEW TOPIC DYNAMICS OF GROUP DECISION-MAKING INTRODUCTION   Community At Work  © 2007     5     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  NEW TOPIC ? ? ? ? Group members are humans.  We do go on tangents.  We do lose track of  the central themes of a discussion.  We do get attached to our ideas.  Even when  we’re all making our best effort to “keep focused” and “stay on track,” we can’t  change the fact that we are individuals with diverging points of view. When a discussion loses focus or becomes confusing, it can appear to many  people that the process is heading out of control.  Yet this is not necessarily  what’s really going on.  Sometimes what appears to be chaos is actually a  prelude to creativity. But how can we tell which is which?  How do we recognize the difference  between a degenerative, spinning-our-wheels version of group confusion and  the dynamic, diversity-stretches-our-imagination version of group confusion? ?

At other times, the same people want to narrow their differences and  aim the discussion toward closure.  These two sets of processes will be referred  to as “divergent thinking” and “convergent thinking.” Here are four examples of the differences between the two thinking processes: DYNAMICS OF GROUP DECISION-MAKING CLOSER TO REALITY   Community At Work  © 2007     7     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  NEW TOPIC DIVERGENT THINKING CONVERGENT THINKING ✔ DECISION POINT Some years ago, a large, well-known computer manufacturer developed a  problem-solving model that was based on the principles of divergent  thinking and convergent thinking.    This model was used by managers throughout the company.  But it didn't  always work so well.  One project manager told us that it took their group  two years to revise the travel expense-reimbursement forms. Why would that happen?  How does group decision-making really work? To explore these questions in greater depth, the following pages present a  series of stop-action snapshots of the process of group decision-making. How does it really work?

DYNAMICS OF GROUP DECISION-MAKING UNANSWERED QUESTIONS    Community At Work  © 2007   8   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    NEW TOPIC The early rounds of a discussion cover safe, familiar territory.  People take  positions that reflect conventional wisdom.  They rehash well-worn  disagreements, and they make proposals for obvious solutions.  This is  natural –  the first ideas we express are the ones we’ve already thought about.

For example, how does an inner-city  public school prevent campus violence?  What steps should a business take  to address the needs of an increasingly diverse workforce?  Cases like these  require a lot of thought; the issues are too complex to be solved with familiar  opinions and conventional wisdom. When a group of decision-makers has to wrestle with a difficult problem,  they will not succeed in solving it until they break out of the narrow band of  familiar opinions and explore a wider range of possibilities.

On such occasions, people tentatively begin to  consider new perspectives.  Some participants might take a risk and express  controversial opinions.  Others might offer ideas that aren’t fully developed.

And it’s particularly challenging to do  so when a wide diversity of perspectives are in play.  In such cases people can  get overloaded, disoriented, annoyed, impatient – or all of the above.  Some  people feel misunderstood and keep repeating themselves.  Others push for  closure.  Sometimes several conversations develop; each occupies the  attention of a few people but seems tangential or irrelevant to everyone else. Thus, even the most sincere attempts to solve difficult problems can – and  often do – dissipate into confusion.

They might say things  like, “I thought we all agreed to stick to the topic,” or “We need better  ground rules,” or “Does anyone understand what’s going on here?”   Groups rarely respond intelligently to this line of thought.  More  commonly, a process comment becomes merely one more voice in the  wilderness – yet another poorly understood perspective that gets absorbed  into the general confusion. We’re stuck . . .

The person-in-charge may believe that s/he has found a perfectly logical  answer to the problem at hand, but this doesn’t mean that everyone else will  telepathically grasp the reasoning behind the decision.  Some people may  still be thinking along entirely different lines. This is the exact situation in which the person-in-charge appears to have  made the decision before the meeting began.  This leads many people to feel  deep distrust.  “Why did s/he tell me I’d have a say in this decision when s/he  already knew what the outcome would be?”  DIVERSITY OF IDEAS  DIVERGENT THINKING  TIME  DYNAMICS OF GROUP DECISION-MAKING POOR TIMING   Community At Work  © 2007     17     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  NEW TOPIC ✔ DECISION POINT Obviously, there’s something wrong with the idealized model.

This is the Diamond of Participatory Decision-Making.  It was developed by Sam  Kaner with Lenny Lind, Catherine Toldi, Sarah Fisk and Duane Berger.   Facilitators can use this model in many ways:  as a diagnostic tool, a road  map, or a teaching tool to provide their groups with shared language and  shared points of reference.   Fundamentally, though, it was created to validate and legitimize the hidden  aspects of everyday life in groups. DYNAMICS OF GROUP DECISION-MAKING   Community At Work  © 2007     21     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  When people experience discomfort in the midst of a group decision-making  process, they often take it as evidence that their group is dysfunctional.  As their  impatience increases, so does their disillusion with the process.   Many projects are abandoned prematurely for exactly this reason.  In such cases,   it’s not that the goals were ill conceived; it’s that the Groan Zone was perceived  as an insurmountable impediment rather than as a normal part of the process.  This is truly a shame.  Too many high-minded and well-funded efforts to resolve  the world’s toughest problems have foundered on the shoals of group dynamics. So let’s be clear-headed about this:  misunderstanding and miscommunication   are normal, natural aspects of participatory decision-making.  The Groan Zone is  a direct, inevitable consequence of the diversity that exists in any group.   Not only that, but the act of working through these misunderstandings is part of  what must be done to lay the foundation for sustainable agreements.  Without  shared understanding, meaningful collaboration is impossible. It is supremely important for people who work in groups to recognize this.   Groups that can tolerate the stress of the Groan Zone are far more likely to  discover common ground.  And common ground, in turn, is the precondition  for insightful, innovative co-thinking.   Understanding group dynamics is an indispensable core competency for  anyone, whether facilitator, leader, or group member, who wants to help their  group tap the enormous potential of participatory decision-making. ✔ Groan   Zone Convergent Zone Business as Usual NEW TOPIC Divergent Zone ?

Their wisdom  emerges from the integration of everybody’s perspectives  and needs.  These are solutions whose range and vision are   expanded to take advantage of the truth held not only by  the quick, the articulate, the influential, and the powerful,  but also of the truth held by those who are shy or  disenfranchised or who think at a slower place.  As the  Quakers say, “Everybody has a piece of the truth.”  SHARED RESPONSIBILITY SHARED  RESPONSIBILITY In participatory groups, members recognize that they  must be willing and able to implement the proposals  they endorse, so they make every effort to give and  receive input before final decisions are made.  They also  assume responsibility for designing and managing the  thinking process that will result in a good decision.  This  contrasts sharply with the conventional assumption  that everyone will be held accountable for the  consequences of decisions made by a few key people. FULL PARTICIPATION FULL PARTICIPATION In a participatory group, all members are encouraged to  speak up and say what’s on their minds.  This strengthens  a group in several ways.  Members become more  courageous in raising difficult issues.  They learn how to  share their “first-draft” ideas.  And they become more  adept at discovering and acknowledging the diversity of  opinions and backgrounds inherent in any group.  MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING In order for a group to reach a sustainable agreement, the  members need to understand and accept the legitimacy  of one another’s needs and goals.  This basic recognition  is what allows people to think from each other’s point of  view, which is the catalyst for developing innovative  ideas that serve the interests of all parties. PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING CORE VALUES   Community At Work  © 2007     25     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  In a typical business-as-usual discussion, self-expression is highly  constrained.  People tend to keep risky opinions to themselves.  The most  highly regarded comments are those that are the clearest, the smartest, the  most well polished.  In business-as-usual discussions, thinking out loud is  treated with impatience; people get annoyed if the speaker’s remarks are  vague or poorly stated.  This induces self-censorship, and reduces the  quantity and quality of participation overall.  A few people end up doing  almost all the talking – and in many groups, those few people just keep  repeating themselves and repeating themselves.  Participatory decision-making groups go through a business-as-usual phase  too.  If familiar opinions lead to a workable solution, then the group can  reach a decision quickly.  But when a business-as-usual discussion does not  produce a workable solution, a participatory group will open up the process  and encourage more divergent thinking.  What does this look like in action?   It looks like people permitting themselves to state half-formed thoughts that  express unconventional – but perhaps valuable – perspectives.  It looks like  people taking risks to surface controversial issues.  It looks like people  making suggestions “from left field” that stimulate their peers to think new  thoughts.  And it also looks like a roomful of people encouraging each other to  do all these things.   ✔ ✔ QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF PARTICIPATION  DURING A BUSINESS-AS-USUAL DISCUSSION FULL PARTICIPATION DURING A PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS HOW PARTICIPATORY VALUES CAN AFFECT GROUP DECISION-MAKING FULL  PARTICIPATION   Community At Work  © 2007    26   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    HOW PARTICIPATORY VALUES CAN AFFECT GROUP DECISION-MAKING MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING In a business-as-usual discussion, persuasion is much more common than  mutual understanding.  The views of the “other side” are dissected point by  point for the purpose of refuting them.  Little effort, if any, is put into  discovering the deeper reasons people believe what they do.  Even when it  appears unlikely that persuasion will change anyone’s mind, participants  continue to press home their points – making it appear as though the  pleasures of rhetoric were the true purpose of continuing the discussion.   Most participants tend to stop listening to each other, except to prepare for  a rebuttal. Building a shared framework of understanding means taking the time to  understand everyone’s perspective in order to find the best idea.  To build  that framework, participants spend time and effort questioning each other,  getting to know one another, learning from each other.  They put  themselves in each other’s shoes.  The process is laced with intermittent  discomfort:  some periods are tense, some are stifling.  But participants keep  plugging away.  Over time, many people gain insight into their own  positions.  They may discover that their own thinking is out-of-date or  misinformed or driven by inaccurate stereotypes.  And by struggling to  acquire such insights, members may discover something else about one  another:  that they truly do care about achieving a mutual goal.   ✔ ✔ EXTENT OF MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING  DURING A BUSINESS-AS-USUAL DISCUSSION EXTENT OF MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING DURING A PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS   27     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    Community At Work  © 2007   HOW PARTICIPATORY VALUES CAN AFFECT GROUP DECISION-MAKING INCLUSIVE  SOLUTIONS Business-as-usual discussions seldom result in inclusive solutions.  More  commonly, people quickly form opinions and take sides.  Everyone expects  that one side will get what they want and the other side won’t.  Disputes,  they assume, will be resolved by the person who has the most authority.   Some groups settle their differences by majority vote, but the effect is the  same.  Expediency rather than innovation or sustainability is the driver of  such solutions.  When the implementation is easy, or when the stakes are  low, expedient solutions are perfectly good –  but not when the stakes are  high, or creativity is required, or broad-based commitment is needed. Inclusive solutions are not compromises; they work for everyone who holds  a stake in the outcome.  Typically, an inclusive solution involves the  discovery of an entirely new option.  For instance, an unexpected  partnership might be forged between former competitors.  Or a group may  invent a nontraditional alternative to a procedure that had previously  “always been done that way.”  Several real-life case examples of inclusive  solutions are presented in Chapter 16.  Inclusive solutions are usually not  obvious – they emerge in the course of the group's persistence.  As  participants learn more about each other’s perspectives, they become  progressively more able to integrate their own goals and needs with those of  the other participants.  This leads to innovative, original thinking.    ✔ ✔ SOLUTIONS RESULTING FROM A  BUSINESS-AS-USUAL DISCUSSION SOLUTIONS RESULTING FROM A PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS   Community At Work  © 2007    28   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    HOW PARTICIPATORY VALUES CAN AFFECT GROUP DECISION-MAKING SHARED RESPONSIBILITY In business-as-usual-discussions, groups rely on the authority of their leaders  and their experts.   The person-in-charge assumes responsibility for defining  goals, setting priorities, defining problems, establishing success criteria, and  arriving at conclusions.  Participants with the most expertise are expected to  distill relevant data, provide analysis, and make recommendations.   Furthermore, the person-in-charge is expected to run the meeting, monitor  the progress of each topic, enforce time boundaries, referee disputes, and  generally take responsibility for all aspects of process management. ✔ THE ENACTMENT OF RESPONSIBILITY  DURING A BUSINESS-AS-USUAL DISCUSSION In order for an agreement to be sustainable, it needs everyone’s support.   Understanding this principle leads everyone to take personal responsibility  for making sure they are satisfied with the proposed course of action.  Every  member of a group, in other words, recognizes that he or she is an owner of  the outcome.  Thus,  people raise whatever issues they consider to be  important.  And everyone is expected to voice concerns if they have them,  even when doing so could delay the group from reaching a decision.   Moreover, the commitment to share responsibility is evident throughout the  process:  in the design of the agenda, in the willingness to discuss and  co-create the procedures they will follow and in the overall expectation that  everyone will accept and take responsibility for making their meetings work.   In summary, participants are expected to take responsibility for both the  content and the process of making decisions together. ✔ SHARED RESPONSIBILITY DURING A PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS   Community At Work  © 2007   THE BENEFITS OF PARTICIPATORY VALUES The participatory values discussed in  this chapter provide the members of a  group with a set of grounding principles  for conducting their meetings.

To do this,  the facilitator encourages full participation, promotes mutual understanding  and cultivates shared responsibility.  By supporting everyone to do their best  thinking, a facilitator enables group members to search for inclusive  solutions and build sustainable agreements.      How much value does this have to a group?  The answer depends on the  group’s goals.  Suppose a group holds meetings specifically for the purpose  of trading information through announcements and reports.  Do the  members of that group need much help to do their best thinking?  Not  really.  Likewise, suppose another group has monthly business-as-usual  meetings to make routine decisions about standard problems, like task  assignments or scheduling.  Those kinds of issues could be handled for years   without any facilitation whatsoever.          But what about more difficult challenges?  For example, suppose a group’s  goal is to reduce violence on a high school campus.  The participants are  parents, teachers, administrators, church leaders, and union officials.  This  group will quickly find out how difficult it is to conduct a sustained,  thoughtful discussion.  Despite a common goal, their frames of reference are  very different.  What seems to a parent like an obvious solution may seem  simplistic to an administrator.  What seems reasonable to an administrator  may seem cowardly to a teacher.  What seems responsible to a teacher may  place too many demands on a parent.  What is the chance that this group  will survive the Groan Zone?   Groups face difficult challenges all the time.  Long-term planning is hard to  do well.  So is restructuring or reengineering.  Here are some other tough  issues groups face:  clarifying roles and responsibilities for individuals  involved in projects that have not been done before; resolving high-stakes  conflicts; introducing new technology into a workplace.  In situations like  these, a group is likely to make wiser, more lasting decisions if they enlist a  facilitator who knows how to support them to do their best thinking. Most individuals working in groups do not know how to solve tough problems  on their own.  They do not know how to build a shared framework of  understanding – they seldom even recognize its significance.  They dread  conflict and discomfort, and they try hard to avoid it.  Yet by avoiding the  struggle to integrate one another’s perspectives, the members of such groups  greatly diminish their own potential to be effective.  They need a facilitator. WHAT IS A FACILITATOR, AND WHY HAVE ONE? THE ROLE OF FACILITATOR    Community At Work  © 2007     33     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  •  “Haven’t we already covered that point?” •  “Let’s keep it simple, please.”  •  “Hurry up – we’re running out of time.” •  “What does that have to do with anything?” •  “Impossible.  Won’t work.  No way.” Statements like these are injunctions against thinking out loud in a group.   They discourage people from saying what they’re thinking.  The message is:   if you want to speak, be simple and polished, and be able to say something  familiar enough or entertaining enough for the group to accept.    The injunctions against thinking in public run like an underground stream  below the surface of a group’s discussion.  Without realizing it, most people  constantly edit their thinking before they speak.  Who wants his or her ideas  criticized before they are fully formed?  Who wants to be told, “We’ve  already answered that question”?  Who wants to make an effort to express a  complex thought while others in the room are doodling or whispering?  This  type of treatment leaves many people feeling embarrassed or inadequate.  To  protect themselves, people censor themselves.  Inherent in group decision-making is the basic problem that people don’t  say what they are really thinking.  It’s hard to take risks, and it’s particularly  hard to do so when the group’s response is likely to be hostile or dismissive.   Yet in so many groups, the norms are oppressive.  Consider these comments: THE FACILITATOR ENCOURAGES FULL PARTICIPATION A Fundamental Problem:  Self-Censorship The Facilitator’s Contribution Imagine now that someone in the group understands this inherent difficulty  and has taken responsibility for helping people overcome it.  Imagine that  this person has the skills and the temperament to draw people out and help  everyone feel heard.  Imagine this person knows how to make room for quiet  members; how to reduce the incidence of premature criticism; how to  support everyone to keep thinking instead of shutting down.  If such a  person is actually permitted to perform this role in a group, the quality of  the group’s participation will vastly improve. THE ROLE OF FACILITATOR  FIRST FUNCTION   Community At Work  © 2007    34   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    The Facilitator’s Contribution A group cannot do its best thinking if the members don’t understand one  another.  But most people find it difficult to detach from their fixed  positions enough to actually listen to what others are saying.  Instead, they  get caught up in amplifying and defending their own perspectives.   Here’s an example.  A group of friends began exploring the possibility of  forming a new business together.  When the topic of money came up, biases  emerged.  One person wanted the profits divided equally.  Another thought  everyone should be paid on the basis of how much revenue they would  generate.  A third person believed the two visionaries should be paid more  to make sure they would not leave.  None of them were able to change their  minds easily.  Nor would it have been realistic to expect them to do so.   Their opinions had been forming and developing for years.   And it gets worse!  When people try to discuss their differences, they often  misunderstand one another.  Each person’s life experiences are so individual,  so singular; everyone has remarkably different views of the world.  What  people expect, what they assume, how they use language, and how they  behave – all these are likely sources of mutual misunderstanding.  What’s  more, when people attempt to clear up a misunderstanding, they usually  want their own ideas understood first.  They may not say so directly, but  their behavior indicates, “I can’t really focus on what you are saying until I  feel that you have understood my point of view.”  This easily becomes a  vicious cycle.  No wonder it’s hard for people to let go of fixed positions! THE ROLE OF FACILITATOR  SECOND FUNCTION A Fundamental Problem:  Fixed Positions THE FACILITATOR PROMOTES MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING A facilitator helps the group realize that sustainable agreements are built on  a foundation of mutual understanding.  S/he helps members see that  thinking from each other’s points of view is invaluable.   Moreover, the facilitator accepts the inevitability of misunderstanding.  S/he  recognizes that misunderstandings are stressful for everyone involved.  The  facilitator knows that people in distress need support; they need to be  treated respectfully.  S/he knows it is essential to stay impartial, honor all  points of view and keep listening, so that each and every group member has  confidence that someone understands them.   Community At Work  © 2007     35     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  THE ROLE OF FACILITATOR  THIRD FUNCTION THE FACILITATOR FOSTERS INCLUSIVE SOLUTIONS A Fundamental Problem:  The Win/Lose Mentality The Facilitator’s Contribution It’s hard for most people to imagine that stakeholders with apparently  irreconcilable differences might actually reach an agreement that benefits all  parties.  Most people are entrenched in a conventional mind-set for solving  problems and resolving conflicts – namely:  “It’s either my way or your way.”   As a result, most problem-solving discussions degenerate into critiques,  rationalizations, and sales jobs, as participants remain attached to their fixed  positions and work to defend their own interests. An experienced facilitator knows how to help a group search for innovative  ideas that incorporate everyone’s points of view.  This can be a challenging  task – the facilitator is often the only person in the room who has even  considered the possibility that inclusive alternatives may exist.  To accomplish this goal, a facilitator draws from knowledge acquired by  studying the theory and practice of collaborative problem solving.  Thus s/he  knows the steps it takes to build sustainable agreements:           • S/he knows how to help groups break free from restrictive    business-as-usual discussions and engage in divergent thinking.        • S/he can help a group survive the Groan Zone as the members    struggle to build a shared framework of understanding.        • S/he knows how to help a group formulate creative proposals    that reflect the weaving together of several perspectives.        • S/he knows how to bring discussions to closure.  In short, the facilitator understands how to build sustainable agreements. When a facilitator introduces a group to the values and methods that foster  inclusive solutions, the impact is profound.  Many people scoff at the very  suggestion that a group can find meaningful solutions to difficult problems.   As they discover the validity of this new way of thinking, they often become  more hopeful about their group’s potential effectiveness.   Community At Work  © 2007    36   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    THE ROLE OF FACILITATOR  FOURTH FUNCTION In group settings, many people defer to the group’s leaders and experts –  often without giving their deferential behavior a second thought.   It’s easy to understand why.  Leaders wield power.  They control resources.  They have access to privileged information.  They are networked with others  who hold power.  Likewise, experts have the training, the knowledge, the  connections, and the familiarity with key issues. Furthermore, the choice to be passive often seems to make such good sense!  For one thing, speaking truth to power can have adverse consequences.   For  another thing,  it may not be worth the bother if “nothing I can say would  matter anyway.”  And finally, if the expert knows more than the others,  why  not accept that person’s judgment and follow his or her advice? Terms like “empowerment,” “enabling environment,” and “self-managing  teams” reflect a growing consensus that relying on authority is both costly  and ineffectual.  As Marvin Weisbord puts it, “People support what they help  to create.”    But even when a leader wants a group to take responsibility, the  factors cited above can inhibit group members from breaking the pattern.  In  turn, this passivity induces the leaders and experts to do the work themselves.   In this way, dependence on authority becomes a self-perpetuating cycle.  THE FACILITATOR CULTIVATES SHARED RESPONSIBILITY A Fundamental Problem:  Reliance on Authority The Facilitator’s Contribution Creating a culture of shared responsibility requires serious effort.  The  group’s leader has to endorse the value of shared responsibility, and both the  leader and the members have to develop the procedures and acquire the  skills to make participatory decision-making work. The existence of a facilitator often makes the critical difference.  This person  is sometimes a coach, sometimes a teacher, sometimes a co-designer of  systems and procedures, and sometimes a motivational speaker who inspires  the group members to stand up and take risks.   In this sense a facilitator is the steward of a profound culture change.  S/he  helps the group evolve from business-as-usual deference and dependency to   assertiveness, collaboration, and shared responsibility. * * M.

This mission is enacted by the facilitator’s four functions:      • encouraging full participation     • promoting mutual understanding    • fostering inclusive solutions    • cultivating shared responsibility When a facilitator effectively performs these functions, the results are  impressive.  S/he strengthens the skills, awareness, and confidence of the  individuals who work in that group; s/he strengthens the structure and  capacity of the group as a whole; and s/he vastly increases the likelihood  that the group will arrive at sustainable agreements.

Conversely, ideas that are presented  poorly or offensively are harder for people to hear.  Of the many ideas that  are put forth in the course of a discussion, some gain quite a bit of attention  while others disappear from awareness as if they had never been spoken.   For example: • Many people become antsy when a speaker is repetitious.  • Group members can be impatient with shy or nervous members  who speak haltingly. • Others may not want to listen to exaggerations, distortions, or  unfounded pronouncements.   • Some people become overwhelmed when a speaker goes on a  tangent and raises a point that seems unrelated to the subject. • And some people are profoundly uncomfortable with anyone who  shows too much emotion.      In any of these circumstances, some listeners will probably ignore the  substance of the ideas being expressed, no matter how valuable those ideas  might be.   Ideas Expressed in Acceptable Communication Styles Ideas Expressed in Unacceptable Communication Styles THE CALCULUS OF DIVERSITY THE LIMITS OF TOLERANCE   Community At Work  © 2007     43     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  Groups that tolerate diverse communication styles can utilize more of the  ideas put forth by its members than groups who need those ideas to be  expressed in an “acceptable fashion.”  By using good listening skills, a  facilitator can be an excellent support to such groups.  For example: • When someone is being repetitious, a facilitator can use  paraphrasing to help that person summarize his or her thinking. • When someone is speaking haltingly, in awkward, broken sentences,  a facilitator can help the speaker relax by drawing him or her out  with open-ended, nondirective questions. • When someone is exaggerating or distorting, a facilitator can  validate the central point without quarreling over its accuracy. • When someone goes off on a tangent, a facilitator can treat the  speaker with full respect by asking the person to help everyone see  how his or her point connects with the broader context.   • When someone expresses himself or herself with intense feeling, a  facilitator can first acknowledge the emotion, then paraphrase the  content of the thought to ensure that the speaker’s point does not  get lost amid the group's gut reactions to the feelings. These situations demonstrate how important it is for a facilitator to listen  skillfully and respectfully to everyone. THE CALCULUS OF DIVERSITY STRETCHING THE LIMITS Ideas Expressed in Acceptable Communication Styles Ideas Expressed in Unacceptable Communication Styles   Community At Work  © 2007    44   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    HOW WHY PARAPHRASING Paraphrasing is fundamental  to active listening.  It is the  most straightforward way to  demonstrate to a speaker that  his or her thoughts were  heard and understood.   The power of paraphrasing is  that it is nonjudgmental and,  hence, validating.  It enables  people to feel that their ideas  are respected and legitimate. Paraphrasing provides the  speaker with a chance to hear  how his or her ideas are being  heard by others. Paraphrasing is especially  useful on occasions when a  speaker’s statements are  convoluted or confusing.   At such times, it serves as a  check for clarification, as in,  “Is this what you mean?”  followed by the paraphrase. In sum, paraphrasing is the  tool of choice for supporting  people to think out loud. In your own words, say what  you think the speaker said. If the speaker’s statement  contains one or two sentences,  use roughly the same number  of words when you paraphrase. If the speaker’s statement  contains many sentences,  summarize it. When you have completed   the paraphrase, look for the  speaker’s reaction.  Say  something like, “Did I get it?”  Verbally or  nonverbally, the  speaker will indicate whether  s/he feels understood. If not,  keep asking for clarification until  you understand what s/he meant. To strengthen the group’s  trust in your objectivity,  occasionally preface your  paraphrase with a comment  like one of these: “It sounds like you’re  saying . . .” “Let me see if I’m understanding you . . .” “Is this what you mean?”   Community At Work  © 2007     45     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  HOW WHY DRAWING PEOPLE OUT It sends the speaker this  message:  “I’m with you; I  understand you so far.  Now  tell me a little more.”  This  message allows people to  express more of what they’re  thinking.  It helps them go  deeper into exploring what  matters to them. When deciding whether to  draw someone out, ask  yourself this question:  “Do I  think I understand the core  of what s/he is trying to say?”   If the answer is no, then  draw the speaker out. Drawing people out is the skill  that supports people to clarify,  develop, and refine their ideas.   The most basic technique of  drawing people out is to  paraphrase the speaker’s  statement, then ask open-ended,  nondirective questions.  Here is a less common method  that also works well.  First,  paraphrase the speaker’s  statement; then use connectors  such as, “So . . .” or “And . . .” or  “Because . . .”  For example,  “You’re saying to wait six more  weeks before we sign the  contract, because . . .” Drawing people out is the tool  of choice for handling two  awkward circumstances: When someone is having  difficulty clarifying an idea.   When someone thinks s/he  is being clear, but the  thought is actually vague or  confusing to the listeners. “Can you say more about that?”  “What do you mean by . . .?” “What’s coming up for you now?” “Can you give me an example?”  “How is that working for you?” “What does this bring up for you?” “What matters to you about that?” “Tell me more.” “How so?” Here are some examples:   Community At Work  © 2007    46   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    HOW WHY MIRRORING Mirroring is a highly  structured, formal version  of paraphrasing, in which  the facilitator repeats the  speaker’s words verbatim. Some people experience  paraphrasing as veiled  criticism.  For them,  mirroring is evidence of the  facilitator’s neutrality. Newly formed groups and  groups unfamiliar with using  a facilitator often benefit  from the trust-building  effects of mirroring. Mirroring speeds up the  tempo of a slow-moving  discussion.  Thus, it is the tool of choice when facilitating  a brainstorming process. In general, the more a  facilitator feels the need to  establish neutrality, the more  frequently he or she should  mirror rather than paraphrase. If the speaker has said a  single sentence, repeat it  back verbatim. If the speaker has said more  than one sentence, repeat  back key words or phrases. In either case, use the speaker’s  words, not your words. The one exception is when  the speaker says, “I.”  Then,  change the pronoun to “you.” Mirroring the speaker’s words  and mirroring the speaker’s  tone of voice are two different  things.  You want your tone of  voice to remain warm and  accepting, regardless of what  the speaker’s voice sounds like. Be yourself with your gestures  and tone of voice; don’t be  wooden or phony.  Remember,  a key purpose of mirroring is  building trust.    Community At Work  © 2007     47     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  HOW WHY GATHERING IDEAS Gathering is the listening  skill that helps participants  build a list of ideas at a  fast-moving pace. Gathering combines  mirroring and paraphrasing  – the reflective listening  skills –  with physical  gestures.  Taking a few  steps to and fro, or making  hand or arm motions, are  physical gestures that  serve as energy boosters.   Such gestures help people  stay engaged. When gathering, be sure to  mirror more frequently  than you paraphrase.  This  establishes a lively yet  comfortable tempo that is  easy for most participants  to follow.  Many people  quickly move into a  rhythm of expressing their  ideas in short phrases –  typically three to five  words per idea.  These  phrases are much easier to  record on flipcharts than  long sentences. Effective gathering starts with a  concise description of the task.   For example, “For the next ten  minutes, please evaluate this  proposal by calling out pros  and cons.  First I’ll ask for  someone to call out a pro  reaction.  Then I’ll ask for a  con.  And so on. We’ll build  both lists at the same time.” If it’s the group’s first time  listing ideas, spend a little  time teaching them suspended  judgment.  Example: “For this  next activity, I’d like everyone  to feel free to express their  ideas, even the offbeat or  unpopular ones.  So please let  this be a time for generating  ideas, not judging  them.  The  discussion can come as soon as  you finish making the list.” Now have the group begin.  As members call out their  items, mirror or paraphrase  whatever is said.  Honor all points of view. If someone says something  that sounds off the wall, just  mirror it and keep moving.   Community At Work  © 2007    48   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    HOW WHY STACKING Stacking is a procedure for  helping people take turns  when several people want to  speak at once. Stacking lets everyone know  that they are, in fact, going  to have their turn to speak.   So instead of competing for  airtime, people are free to  listen without distraction. In contrast, when people  don’t know when or even  whether their turn will come,  they can’t help but vie for  position.  This leads to  various expressions of  impatience and disrespect,  especially interruptions. Facilitators who do not stack  have to pay attention to the  waving of hands and other  nonverbal messages that say,  “I’d like to speak, please.”  Inevitably, some members  are skipped or ignored.  With  stacking, a facilitator creates a  sequence that includes all  those who want to speak. Stacking is a four-step procedure.   First, the facilitator asks those  who want to speak to raise their  hands.  Second, s/he creates a  speaking order by assigning a  number to each person.  Third,  s/he calls on people when their  turn to speak arrives.  Fourth,  after the final speaker, the  facilitator asks if anyone else  wants to speak.  If so, the  facilitator starts another stack.   Here’s a demonstration: Step 1.  “Would all who want to  speak, please raise your hands.” Step 2.  “Tyrone, you’re first.   Deb, you’re second.  James,  you’re third.” Step 3.  [When Tyrone has  finished] “Who was second? Was  it you, Deb?  Okay, go ahead.” Step 4.  [After the last person  has spoken] “Who’d like to  speak now?  Are there any  more comments?”  Then,  start a new stack, and repeat  Steps 2 through 4.   Community At Work  © 2007     49     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  HOW WHY Step 3.  “Am I getting it right?”  Often someone will say, “No,  you missed mine!” If so, don’t  argue or explain; just validate  the comment and move on. TRACKING Step 2.  “One conversation  appears to be about roles and  responsibilities.  Another has  to do with finances.  And a  third is about what you’ve  learned by working with the  last person who held this job.” Step 1.  “It seems that there  are three conversations going  on right now.  I want to make  sure I’m tracking them.” Step 4.  “Any more comments?”  Now build a new stack. Tracking means keeping track  of the various lines of  thought that are going on  simultaneously within a  single discussion.   For example, suppose a group  is discussing a plan to hire a  new employee.  Assume that  two people are talking about  roles and responsibilities.   Two others are discussing  financial implications.  And  two more are reviewing their  experiences with the  previous employee.  In such  cases, people need help  keeping track of all that’s  going on, because they are  focused primarily on  clarifying their own ideas. People often act as though  the particular issue that  interests them is the one that  everyone should focus on.   Tracking makes it visible that  several threads of the topic  are being discussed.  In so  doing, it affirms that each  thread is equally valid. Tracking is a four-step process.   First, the facilitator indicates  that s/he is going to step back  and summarize the discussion  so far.  Second, s/he names the  different conversations that  have been in play.  Third, s/he  checks for accuracy with the  group.  Fourth, s/he now invites  the group to resume discussion.   Community At Work  © 2007    50   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    HOW WHY ENCOURAGING Encouraging is the art of  creating an opening for  people to participate,  without putting any one  individual on the spot. There are times in a  meeting when some folks  may appear to be “sitting  back” or “letting others  do all the work.”  This  doesn’t necessarily mean  that they are lazy or  irresponsible.  Instead, it  may be that they are not  feeling engaged by the  discussion.  With a little  encouragement to  participate, they often  discover an aspect of the  topic that holds meaning  for them. Encouraging is especially  helpful during the early  stage of a discussion, while  members are still warming  up.  As people get more  engaged, they don’t need  as much encouragement to  participate. Here are some examples of the  technique of encouraging: A related technique is to  begin by restating the  objective of the discussion  and then using encouraging to  increase engagement: “We’ve been looking for the   root causes of this problem.  Any other possibilities?” “Who else has an idea?” “Is there a student’s  perspective on this issue?” “Does anyone have a war story  you’re willing to share?” “What do others think?” “Jim just offered us an idea  that he called a ‘general  principle.’  Can anyone give  us an example of this  principle in action?” “Are there comments from  anyone who hasn’t spoken  for awhile?” “What was said at table two?” “Is this discussion raising  questions for anyone?”   Community At Work  © 2007     51     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  HOW WHY BALANCING The direction of a discussion  often follows the lead set by  the first few people who  speak on that topic.  Using  balancing, a facilitator helps  a group broaden its  discussion to include other  perspectives that may not  yet have been expressed. Balancing undercuts the  common myth that silence  indicates agreement.  It  provides welcome support  to individuals who don’t  feel safe to express views  that they perceive as  minority positions. In addition to the support it  provides to individuals,  balancing also has a positive  effect on the norms of the  group.  It sends the message,  “It is acceptable for people to  speak their mind, no matter  what opinions they hold.” When a group appears caught  between two polizarized  positions, balancing often  reveals the presence of  alternative positions. Here are some examples of  balancing in action: “Are there other ways of  looking at this issue?” “Does everyone else agree  with this perspective?” “Okay, we have heard where  three people stand on this  matter. Does anyone else  have a different position?” “Can anyone play devil’s  advocate for a few minutes?” “Let’s see how many people  stand on each side of this  issue.  We’re not making a  decision, and I’m not asking  you to vote.  This is just an  opinion poll to find out how  much controversy we have  in the room.  Ready?  How  many people think it would  be good if . . .?” “So, we’ve heard the X point  of view and the Y point of  view.  Is there a third way of  looking at this?”   Community At Work  © 2007    52   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    HOW WHY MAKING SPACE FOR A QUIET PERSON Making space sends the quiet  person this message:  “If you  don’t wish to talk now, that’s  fine.  But if you would like to  speak, here’s an opportunity.” Every group has some  members who are highly  verbal and others who speak  less frequently.  When a  group has a fast-paced  discussion style, quiet  members and slower thinkers  may have trouble getting a  word in edgewise. Some people habitually keep  out of the limelight because  they are afraid of being  perceived as rude or  competitive.  Others might  hold back when they’re new  to a group and unsure of  what’s acceptable and what’s  not.  Still others keep their  thoughts to themselves  because they’re convinced  their ideas aren’t “as good as”  those of others.  In all of these  cases, people benefit from a  facilitator who makes space  for them to participate. Keep an eye on the quiet  members.  Be on the lookout  for body language or facial  expressions that may indicate  their desire to speak. Invite them to speak.  For  example, “Was there a thought  you wanted to express?” or “Did  you want to add anything?” or  “You look as if you might be  about to say something . . .” If they decline, be gracious and  move on.  No one likes being  put on the spot, and everyone  is entitled to choose whether  and when to participate. If necessary, hold others off.   For example, if a quiet member  makes a move to speak but  someone jumps in ahead, say,  “Let’s go one at a time. Terry,  why don’t you go first?” If participation is very uneven,  consider suggesting a structured  go-around to give each person a  chance to speak.   Community At Work  © 2007     53     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  HOW WHY ACKNOWLEDGING FEELINGS “Is this what you’re feeling . . . ?”  “Seems like this discussion is  bringing up something for you.  Are you feeling disappointed?” “Looks like you have some  feelings about that.  Are you  at all frustrated?” “From the tone of your voice,  I wonder if you’re feeling . . . ?” “Sounds as though you might  be feeling worried. Am I right?” People communicate their  feelings through their  conduct, their language,  their tones of voice, their  facial expressions, and so on.   These communications have  a direct impact on anyone  who receives them. That impact is much easier to  manage when feelings are  communicated directly  rather than indirectly, and  intentionally rather than  unconsciously. Yet the fact remains that   human beings are frequently  unaware of what they’re  feeling.  In other words, our  communications are often  driven or shaped by  information that we aren’t   even aware of sending. By identifying a feeling and  naming it, a facilitator raises  everyone’s awareness.  By  then paraphrasing and  drawing people out, the  facilitator assists the group to  recognize and accept the  feelings of its members. Second, pose a question that  names the feelings you see. Third, use facilitative listening  to support people to respond to  the feelings you named. Here are some examples of the  second step in action.  As the  examples suggest, be sure to pose  any observations as a question. First, when a group is engaging  in a difficult conversation, pay  attention to the emotional tone.   Look for cues that might  indicate the presence of feelings. Acknowledging feelings is a  three-step process:   Community At Work  © 2007    54   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    HOW WHY VALIDATING Validating is the skill that  legitimizes and accepts a  speaker’s opinion or feeling,  without agreeing that the  opinion is “correct.” Many facilitators wonder  whether it is possible to  support the expression of a  controversial opinion without  appearing to take sides.  Can  we acknowledge someone’s  feelings without implying we  agree with the speaker’s  rationale for feeling that way?  The answer is yes.  Validating  means recognizing a group’s  divergent opinions, not taking  sides with any one of them.   Just as you don’t have to agree  with an opinion to paraphrase  it, you do not have to agree  that a feeling is justified in  order to accept and validate it. The basic message of validating  is, “Yes, clearly that’s one way  to look at it.  Others may see it  differently; even so, your point  of view is entirely legitimate.” Validating has three steps.  First,  paraphrase.  Second, assess  whether the speaker needs added  support.  Third, offer the support. Step 1.  Paraphrase or draw out  a person’s opinion or feeling. Step 2.  Ask yourself, “Does  this person need extra support?  Has he or she just said  something that takes a risk?” Validating often induces the  affected individual to open up  and say more.  If this happens,  be respectful.  You’re not  agreeing; you’re supporting  someone to express their truth. Step 3.  Offer that support by  acknowledging the legitimacy of what the person just said.   For example: “I see what you’re saying.” “I know just how that feels.” “I get why this matters to you.”  “I can see how you got there.” “Now I see where you’re  coming from.”   Community At Work  © 2007     55     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  This involves putting oneself  in another person’s shoes and  looking out on the world  through that person’s eyes.  The listener then imagines  what the person might be  feeling, and why – and forms  this insight into a statement  of acceptance and support. Empathizing is commonly  defined as the ability to  understand and share the  feelings of another. Empathizing can be performed   using different techniques. Another technique is to  mention the factors that led up  to the person’s experience:   “After all the effort you made  to keep this project alive, I  imagine this news might be  quite upsetting.” The most basic technique is to  name what you think a person is  experiencing.  For example, “I  imagine this news might be quite  upsetting to you.”  A third technique is to  speculate on future impacts.  “I  can see how this news could  also play havoc with your  other commitments.  Has that  brought up any feelings yet?”  A fourth option is to identify  concerns about communicating  these feelings to others.  “I can  imagine it might be hard to talk  about this topic in this group.” HOW WHY EMPATHIZING Always ask for confirmation.  If  the speaker says, “That’s not my  experience,” encourage him or  her to correct your perception. Moreover, empathizing  benefits the entire group,  providing everyone with a  fuller, compassionate   understanding of a person’s  subjective reality.   Empathizing and validating  both serve to identify and  legitimize feelings.   Empathizing goes one step  further: the listener attempts  to identify with and share the  actual feeling.  For example, “If it were me I’d be worried!”    “That must be really hard.”   “I'd be feeling very, very sad.”   Community At Work  © 2007    56   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    HOW WHY INTENTIONAL SILENCE Intentional silence is highly  underrated.  It consists of a  pause, usually lasting no  more than a few seconds,  and it is done to give a  speaker that brief extra  “quiet time” to discover  what s/he wants to say. Some people need brief silence  in order to organize a complex  thought and turn it into a  coherent statement. Others  need a bit of time to consider  whether to take a risk and  make a controversial  statement.  Still others need  the silence to digest what has  already been said, in order to  understand their own  reactions better.  Intentional silence can also be  used to honor moments of  exceptional poignancy.  After  a statement of passion or  vulnerability, intentional  silence allows the group to  pause, reflect, and make sense  of the experience. Ten seconds of silence can seem  a lot longer than it really is.   The crucial element of this  listening skill is the facilitator's  ability to tolerate the  awkwardness most people feel  during even brief silences.  If  the facilitator can survive it,  everyone else will too. With eye contact and body  language, stay focused on the  speaker. Say nothing, not even, “Hmm”  or “Uh-huh.”  Do not even nod  or shake your head.  Just stay  relaxed and pay attention. If necessary, hold up a hand to  keep others from breaking the  silence. Sometimes everyone in the  group is confused or agitated or  having trouble focusing.  At  such times, silence may be very  helpful.  Say, “Let’s take a few  moments of silence to think  what this means to each of us.”   Community At Work  © 2007     57     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  HOW WHY LINKING Linking is a listening skill that  invites a speaker to explain  the relevance of a statement  he or she just made. In conversations about  complex subjects, it is hard  for everyone to stay focused  on the same thing at the same  time.  People often raise issues  that seem tangential – in  other words, irrelevant – to  everyone else. When this occurs, it’s not  uncommon to hear a group  member say something like,  “Let’s get back on track.”   Or, “Can we put this in the  parking lot?”  Remarks like  those are hard to argue  with.  Unless a facilitator  intervenes, the speaker is  likely to simply stop talking. Yet ideas that seem unrelated  to the main topic can actually  be connected with it, often in  unexpected ways.   The  thought that comes from left  field is often the one that  triggers the breakthrough.                 Linking is a four-step process.   First, paraphrase the statement.  Second, ask the speaker to link  the idea with the main topic.   Third, paraphrase and validate  the speaker’s explanation.   Fourth, follow with an action  from the list below. Step 1.  Paraphrase.  A speaker  who fears getting off track needs  the support and reassurance of  paraphrasing. Step 2.  Ask for the linkage:   “How does your idea link up  with . . . [our topic]? Can you  help us make the connection?” Step 3.  Paraphrase, then validate  the explanation:   “Are you saying . . . [paraphrase]?”  Then say, “I see what you mean.” Step 4.  Follow with one of these: Draw out the speaker’s idea. Use balancing or encouraging to pull for other reactions. Return to stacking.   (“Okay, we have Jim’s idea. Whose turn is it to go next?”) Use a parking lot flipchart.   Community At Work  © 2007    58   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    HOW WHY LISTENING FOR COMMON GROUND Listening for common ground   is a powerful intervention  when group members are  polarized.  It validates the  group’s areas of disagreement  and focuses the group on  their areas of agreement. Many disputes contain  elements of agreement.  For  example, civil rights activists  often argue vehemently over  priorities and tactics, even  while they agree on broad  goals.  When disagreements  cause the members of a  group to take polarized  positions, it becomes hard for  people to recognize that they   have anything in common.   This isolation can sometimes  be overcome when the  facilitator validates both the  differences in the group and  the areas of common ground. Listening for common ground is  also a tool for instilling hope.   People who believe they are  opposed on every front may  discover that they share a  value, a belief, or a goal. Listening for common ground is a  four-step process.  First, indicate  that you are going to summarize  the group’s differences and  similarities.  Second, summarize  differences.  Third, note areas of  common ground.  Fourth, check  for accuracy.  Here’s an example: Step 1.  “Let me summarize what  I’m hearing from each of you.   I’m hearing a lot of differences  but also some similarities.” Step 2.  “It sounds as if one  group wants to leave work early  during the holiday season, and  the other group would prefer to  take a few days of vacation.”  Step 3.  “Even so, you all seem  to agree that you want some  time off before New Year’s.”  Step 4.  “Have I got it right?”  Caution:  To use this technique  effectively, make sure to use it  with all parties.  People who do  not feel validated are likely to  continue advocating for their  position regardless of the  quality of their thinking.   Community At Work  © 2007     59     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  HOW WHY LISTENING WITH A POINT OF VIEW On occasion a group’s  facilitator is also the group’s leader (or expert, or staff  person) – in other words, a  person who is not a neutral  third party.  This creates a  dilemma:  How does this  person promote his or her  own point of view effectively,  while still making room for all  other opinions to be voiced? The resolution – first and  foremost – involves the  mind-set of the person who is  playing the dual role. On the one hand, s/he has to  retain the leader’s mind-set,  and be responsible for clarifying  his or her own thinking and  communicating it effectively. On the other hand, s/he has  to adopt the facilitator’s  mind-set, and care about  helping the group do its best  thinking.  This means wanting  to support others to develop  their lines of thought.  Listening with a point of view   supports this person to keep  both roles in balance. Listening with a point of view is  a five-step process:   Step 1.  As the leader (or expert  or staff person), raise the issue  about which you have an  opinion.  State your position. Step 2.  Ask for reactions.   Step 3.  Respond to participants’  comments as a facilitator  would, by paraphrasing and  drawing people out.  Err on the  side of more drawing out rather  than less.  (Many people find it  hard to challenge authority;  they may need extra support to  risk voicing a differing opinion.) Step 4.  After at least two moves  of facilitative listening, give  yourself the floor to speak.  Now  make statements that reflect  your own perspective.  Answer  questions, provide information,  explain, advocate, and so forth. Step 5.  Repeat Steps 2 through 4  as needed, remembering to  balance expressing your own  point of view with at least twice  as much facilitative listening.   Community At Work  © 2007    60   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    HOW WHY Good facilitators know the  value of encouraging  participants to engage in  thoughtful discussion.  But  the most interesting  conversations can also be the  hardest ones to close. SUMMARIZING If the facilitator does an  effective job of summarizing,  people will feel ready to  move on to a new topic.   However, if the facilitator  does a poor job of it, some of  the participants will push  back and attempt to keep the  discussion going.  This places  the facilitator in an awkward  position, which probably  could have been avoided  with better technique. Making a deliberate effort to  summarize a discussion also  helps participants consolidate  their thinking.  The restatement  of key themes and main points  provides people with mental  categories.  These internal  categories serve as both  memory aids and devices for  improving understanding. Summarizing is a five-step  process: Step 1.  Restate the question that  began the discussion:  “We’ve  been discussing the success of  your program.” Step 2.  Indicate the number of  key themes you heard:  “I think  people raised three themes.” Step 3.  Name the first theme, and  mention one or two key points  related to that theme:  “The first  theme was about your strategy.   You explored its effectiveness and   suggested some improvements.” Step 4.  Repeat this sequence for  each theme:  “Another theme was  the validity of your main goal.   You questioned whether it was  feasible and realistic.  Finally, you  examined some personnel issues  and you created a new staff role.” Step 5.  Make a statement that  bridges to the next topic:  “We’ve  done some thinking about the  effectiveness of the program.   Now let’s discuss specific changes  that you might want to propose.”  61 USING MARKERS AND FLIPCHARTS TO SUPPORT FULL PARTICIPATION ➧  The Power of a Group Memory ➧  The Role of ChartWriter ➧  Lettering ➧  Colors ➧  Symbols ➧  Formats ➧  Spacing ➧  Tips and Technique ➧  After the Meeting CHARTWRITING  TECHNIQUE 55   Community At Work  © 2007    62   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    In many groups, participation is not balanced.  A few people do most of the  talking, while others sit and listen.  This pattern shifts dramatically when  people’s ideas are written on flipcharts that everyone can see. Writing a group’s ideas on flipcharts and displaying them on the wall  provides participants with a group memory.*  This strengthens full  participation in several ways.   First, it validates.  Recording people’s words sends the message, “This is a  valuable idea.”  And when their ideas are valued, people feel valued. That’s the  central benefit of group memory. Second, having a group memory extends the limits of the human brain.  A vast  amount of scientific research has shown that most people can retain roughly  seven chunks of information in their short-term memory.  Once someone’s  short-term memory is full, the person simply cannot absorb another idea  without forgetting something.  (For example, you can probably remember a  new friend’s seven-digit phone number by repeating it over and over. But try  remembering two new phone numbers at once!)   In a meeting this can pose a real problem. Typically, people hang onto the  ideas they care about, and let the rest float in one ear and out the other.  The  group memory solves this problem.  Participants know that if they forget  something, they can look at it on the chart.  This frees the mind and  supports people to keep thinking. ** It is important to recognize that the group memory is not merely a tool for  keeping the record of a meeting.  Primarily it is a vehicle for encouraging full  participation.  It equalizes and balances.  It enlivens the discussion.  It helps  people work toward understanding and integrating each other’s points of  view.  In summary, group memory is one of the facilitator’s most fundamental  tools for supporting groups to do their best thinking. The term “group memory” was coined by Geoff Ball, a California specialist in multi-party conflict  resolution.  He is the founder of RESOLVE, one of the nation’s first consulting firms to promote  collaborative problem-solving as an alternative to litigation.  For a detailed discussion on the benefits of using a group memory, see “The Case for a Group Memory” by  M. Doyle and D. Straus in How to Make Meetings Work (pp. 38–48). New York:  Jove Press, 1982.   * THE POWER OF A GROUP MEMORY **   Community At Work  © 2007     63     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  The chartwriter is the person who records the group’s thinking on flipcharts.   This role is also referred to as “the recorder” or “the scribe.”  The reason to  have a chartwriter is to capture ideas and build a group memory.  The purpose of having a group memory has already been discussed:  it  supports good thinking and strengthens participation.  But in order for the  group memory to fulfill that purpose it has to be used by the participants –  and that’s where the role of the chartwriter makes all the difference.  Sloppy,  crowded, illegible charts are not much better than no charts at all.  By  learning the simple techniques discussed in this chapter, a chartwriter can  make the group memory inviting, helpful, and easy to read. Even more important than visual effects, the chartwriter’s neutrality is  essential.  The chartwriter should record the group members’ exact words  whenever possible.  People want to see their own ideas written down.   Sometimes, of course, a person’s statement is too long or complex to be  recorded verbatim.  In those cases, the facilitator often assists the speaker by  paraphrasing and summarizing the speaker’s key themes.  It is permissible for  the chartwriter to record the facilitator’s paraphrase as long as the chartwriter  believes the speaker has assented to the rewording. Moreover, it is imperative that the chartwriter treat each person’s  contributions with equal respect.  It is up to the group, not the chartwriter,  to determine which ideas are valuable and which are not.   Many facilitators tend to perform the role of chartwriter themselves.  Other  facilitators bring a chartwriter with them whenever a meeting is larger than  five or six participants.  In general the latter aproach is superior to the  former.  To be optimally effective, facilitators should face forward, with their  attention focused on their groups.  By looking people in the eyes, a facilitator  can pay close attention to group dynamics, and stay connected with the  individuals and the process.  In contrast, chartwriters stand with their backs  to the group.  Their attention is consumed by the meanings of people’s  words and keeping up with the flow of the discussion. Some groups might not want an outside chartwriter.  The facilitator can then  ask the group to provide a chartwriter, either by assigning someone the role  in advance or by providing volunteers at key points in the meeting. THE ROLE OF CHARTWRITER   Community At Work  © 2007    64   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    11.. PRINT IN CAPITAL LETTERS Most group members have an easier time reading UNIFORM, CAPITAL LETTERS.   Writing in cursive may be slightly faster, but taking a few extra seconds to print will  make your text more legible. * Thanks to Jennifer Hammond-Landau, noted San Francisco graphic facilitator, who gave us this  tip in 1982. MAKE  T H I C K - L I N E D  LETTERS Use the wide end of the marker tip.  Press firmly against the paper.  Firm, thick-lined  lettering is much easier to read from a distance than soft, thin-lined lettering. 22.. WRITE STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN Straight lettering is easier to read than slanted  lettering. 33.. CLOSE YOUR LETTERS Don’t leave gaps in letters like B and P.  Letters without gaps are easier to read and less  confusing.  In contrast, letters with gaps require more concentration from the reader. 44.. USE PLAIN, BLOCK LETTERS Letters without curlicues are easier on the eyes.  Fancy script slows down reading  time, so it should be saved for occasional special effects. 55.. PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT If your printing isn’t perfect, don’t panic – practice! A painless way to improve lettering is to practice  whenever you might otherwise be  doodling or taking notes, or writing grocery lists, memos, love letters – whatever.   Habits you develop with pen and paper will transfer to the flipchart. * 66.. LETTERING   Community At Work  © 2007     65     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  COLORS 11.. ALTERNATE COLORS People read faster, retain more, and have a longer concentration span when the text is  written in two or three colors.  Therefore, switch colors each time a group member states a  new idea.  It’s not necessary to follow a pattern in your alternation.  The goal is simply to  break up the monotony. USE  EARTH TONES  FOR TEXT The earth tones, also called the  “soft colors,” are blue, brown, purple, and green.  They  are easy on the eyes. 22.. USE  HH O O TT  CCO OLLO O RR SS  FOR HIGHLIGHTING The “hot colors” are orange, red, yellow, and pink.  They are harder on the eyes and  should be reserved for borders, shading and underlining, and for special symbols like  arrows or stars.  Note also that yellow is very difficult to see at a distance. 33.. AVOID BLACK Reserve black for numbering pages.  It’s too heavy and dense for much else. 44.. BEWARE OF COLOR CODING Beginners often try to organize their work by color coding – one color for headings, a  second color for key points, a third for sub-points, and so on. This usually turns into a  mixed-up mess.  A group’s thinking process is generative and dynamic – the categories  keep shifting as people build on each other’s ideas.  “Rough-draft thinking” is not the time  for color coding.  By contrast, color coding is very effective with documents like agendas  that are created before the meeting begins or whenever the content of the document is  known in advance. 55.. USE THE CHARTWRITER’S GRIP TO HOLD FOUR MARKERS AT ONCE The chartwriter’s grip involves sticking a marker  between  each finger on the hand you don’t write with.  Keep the  tops off and point the ink-tips outward.  This way, you are  ready for action with any color! 66..   Community At Work  © 2007    66   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    Bullets are big dots that make items stand apart  from one another.  Use them often – especially  when listing ideas. 11.. SYMBOLS BULLETS STARS CIRCLES BORDERS A star indicates that something is especially  noteworthy. Borders have a pleasant visual impact.  They can be  used to frame a whole page or to highlight certain  blocks of text or a title.  Pink or orange borders work  beautifully. T I T L E Circles can do many things, such as: •  Lasso one idea and connect it with another. •  Draw attention to a decision that has been made. •  Highlight the most important issue on the page. •  Separate and categorize information on the page. •  Break up the visual monotony of a page full of text. 22.. 33.. 44..   Community At Work  © 2007     67     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  Many ideas can be expressed with simple drawings. 55.. An arrow is a very powerful symbol, because it  grapically represents a connection between two  items.  The nature of that connection might be  causal, sequential, logical, or even cyclical.  Usually  the meaning of the arrow is self-evident from the  context.  For example:     •  Ideas A and B (above right) form a vicious cycle.     •  Idea 1 comes first; Idea 2 comes second.     •  Ideas X, Y and Z all belong to Topic Q. Because an arrow is so powerful, it is imperative that  the chartwriter take extra care not to draw an arrow  unless the connection has been explicitly suggested  by a participant.  In other words, remain neutral.   Let the group do its own thinking. ARROWS SYMBOLS X Y Z Q A B S * * The “Star-Person” was created by David Sibbet, who has developed a large family of easy-to- draw Star-People.  See his Fundamentals of Graphic Language Practice Book (San Francisco:  Grove Consultants, 1991). 1 2 OTHER SYMBOLS 66..   Community At Work  © 2007    68   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    FORMATS The list is the most common format. It consists of a title, or heading, followed  by a series of items, each demarked by an  oversized dot, often called a “bullet.” Some lists contain subdivisions of items  organized into categories, as shown in the  right-hand diagram.  For lists of this type,  the category titles are numbered or  underlined.  Bullets are used to demark  the items within each category. 11.. THE LIST TITLE •  ITEM •  ITEM •  ITEM •  ITEM •  ITEM TITLE 1.  SUB-TITLE       •  ITEM       •  ITEM 2.  SUB-TITLE       •  ITEM       •  ITEM A matrix is a grid with headings placed both  horizontally (across the top) and vertically  (along the left side).  A matrix can be used  to help a group discuss relationships  between two or more variables. THE MATRIX IDEA 2 CON IDEA 1 PRO IDEA 3 22.. A flowchart can describe how something  works, or it can show a sequence of events. THE FLOWCHART THEN OR IF THIS THAT THIS OUTCOME A OUTCOME B 33..   Community At Work  © 2007     69     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  44.. Open discussions are unstructured.  During a period of open discussion, expect the  group’s ideas to flow in many different directions.  The chartwriter's job is to use a  recording format that preserves maximum flexibility . •  Mentally divide the sheet of paper into five sections.  Do not actually  draw the sections on the paper.  (The illustration below is meant only  to show you, the reader, the arrangement of the sections.) •  As you record the discussion, put each completely new theme in a  different section.  Within each section, record using the list format.     Leave the center section blank. •  As the discussion moves along, group members often discover that they can  use the center space to list central themes of the discussion. If the writing surface is wide, hang sheets of flipchart paper side-by-side on a large  wall and proceed as follows. The safest approach is to skip three or four lines after each new thought.  As the discussion  unfolds, go back to fill in the blank spaces if relevant ideas emerge. An orbit diagram can highlight  a key point and describe others  in a less linear way. MORE FORMATS THE ORBIT DIAGRAM KEY POINT MOOT POINT LOW POINT YOUR POINT MY POINT HIGH POINT NEW POINT DON’T POINT FORMATS FOR OPEN DISCUSSION 55.. 5 1 2 3 4   Community At Work  © 2007    70   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    Start a new page before you really need to, because a group will lower its output at the  end of a page.  Participants often behave as if the task is finished once the page is full.   If you start a new page, it is amazing how frequently people catch a second wind and  start generating new material. DON’T CROWD THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE 77.. SPACING MARGINS Margins should be at least two inches on all four sides of the page.  Having a wide  margin beside each line of text encourages members to edit or add to their previous  ideas.  This space is also useful for tallying votes – as, for example, when group  members prioritize a long list of ideas. 22.. One inch is a good height for letters.  You may have to write larger if the group is  large – say, more than 30 – because some people will be sitting too far away to read  one-inch letters.   11.. LETTER SIZE BETWEEN LINES Leave roughly one inch between lines of text, and one and a half inches between lines  when switching color. 33.. INDENTING Indenting is confusing because charts don't follow a “friendly letter paragraph format."   Furthermore, using indentation to demark subcategories will create the same potential  difficulty as color-coding:  people’s categories shift as their discussion unfolds. 44.. UNDERLINING Underline titles and subtitles only, and leave two inches below the line. 55.. WHITE SPACE White space is your friend.  Especially at the margins – top, bottom and sides  – an  open, spacious page looks inviting and gives the group a breezy feeling about its work.   Too much space is not advisable, yet even that is preferable to overcrowded pages.  Dense text discourages readers from staying attentive to all that is being recorded. 66..

For example, do not write  “defnt” for “definite” or “expl” for “explain.”  Here’s the guideline:  Will this be  understandable to someone who did not attend the meeting? 55.. USE ONLY STANDARD ABBREVIATIONS Every page needs a title, even if it says “[title of previous page] page 2.” 66.. TITLE EVERY PAGE Invite people to read over your work.  Accept corrections gladly.  Even if it messes up  your beautiful chart, remember that’s how it becomes their chart. 77.. ENCOURAGE PROOFREADING “Send thank-you note to Bill” is much easier to understand than “note to Bill” because  it includes a noun and a verb.  Here’s the guideline:  Will it be understandable in a week? 11.. SENTENCES ARE EASY TO READ Some beginners feel awkward using these pronouns.  For example, instead of writing,  “We want a meeting,” a beginner might write, “They want a meeting” or “You want a  meeting.”  Remember:  it’s the group’s record – write with their voice. 22.. DON’T BE SHY – WRITE “WE” AND “I” Example:  If you hear “I hope we remember to write a warm thank-you note to that  great caterer,” get the key verbs and nouns first:  “Send note to caterer.” 33.. VERBS AND NOUNS ARE HIGH PRIORITY It’s fine to write the adjectives and adverbs – like “warm” and “great” in the example  above – but only if you have the time. 44.. ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS ARE LOW PRIORITY   Community At Work  © 2007     73     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  AFTER THE MEETING Each of the previous four steps is an excellent opportunity to demonstrate thoroughness  and efficiency.  Group members will notice it.  They may not acknowledge it verbally,  but they will recognize that they are working with a professional. 55.. THESE STEPS DEMONSTRATE PROFESSIONALISM Make sure all pages are titled, numbered, and arranged in a way that will be  understandable at a later date.  11.. CHECK TITLES AND PAGE NUMBERS Flipcharts are often brought back to the next meeting.  It is difficult to hang pages that  have fold creases in them.  It’s also difficult to read them.  Therefore, when you’re taking  charts off the wall, roll rather than fold. Label the outside of the rolled-up paper with three items of information:     •  Name of the meeting     •  Date of the meeting     •  Topics ROLL UP THE PAGES TOGETHER, AND LABEL THEM • Staff Meeting • October 23 • pp. 1–4  Goals of Dept. Re-org. • pp. 5–9  Unsolved Problems 22.. 44.. •  Will you be responsible for organizing and distributing copies of the flipcharts, or    will you be handing off the charts “as is” to someone in the group? •  If you are responsible for creating the documents, consider photographing the  charts with a digital camera.  Copies can be downloaded and printed inexpensively.    Letter-size documents are much easier to copy, store, and distribute than flipcharts,  and photos are more effective as a memory jog than typed minutes of a meeting. CLARIFY YOUR ROLE IN RELATION TO DOCUMENTATION 33.. SECURE THE PAGES WITH TWO RUBBER BANDS Most people instinctively reach for cellophane tape or masking tape to secure the pages  once they’re rolled.  Don’t.  The adhesive often sticks to the pages so well that the pages rip  when you peel them apart.  Instead, use paper clips or rubber bands.   75 TECHNIQUES FOR SUPPORTING A  FREE-FLOWING EXCHANGE OF IDEAS ➧  Facilitator’s Two Central Questions ➧  Organizing the Flow of a Discussion ➧  Informal Techniques for        Broadening Participation ➧  Helping Individuals Make Their Points ➧  Managing Divergent Perspectives ➧  Techniques for Focusing a Discussion ➧  Further Process Considerations FACILITATING OPEN DISCUSSION66   Community At Work  © 2007    76   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    When facilitating an open discussion, a facilitator is making decisions  constantly.  (“How much should I say?  When should I say it?”)  In most  cases, these decisions are simply judgment calls.  But underlying such  judgments are two central questions.  The first question involves deciding  who talks when.  The second involves deciding what content to support. DETERMINING WHO TALKS WHEN    Should the facilitator keep attention  focused on the person currently speaking?  Or should the facilitator move  the focus away from that speaker and call on others?  The theory and  technique of making this choice are discussed in the sections “Organizing  the Flow of a Discussion,” “Informal Techniques for Broadening  Participation,” and “Helping Individuals Make Their Points.” FOCUSING THE DISCUSSION    Should the facilitator keep the focus on the  specific points being made by the current speaker?  Or should the facilitator  help the group move away from those specific points and move on to an  entirely different line of thought?   The theory and technique of making this  choice is discussed in the “Managing Divergent Perspectives” section.  FACILITATING OPEN DISCUSSION Open discussion is the unstructured, conversational, familiar way of talking  in groups.  People speak up when they want to, and talk for as long as they  choose.  It is absolutely essential to know how to facilitate an open  discussion; it is by far the most common approach to thinking in groups.   Open discussion serves many purposes.  If someone raises an important  issue, the entire group can discuss it.  And if the issue does not engage the  group, someone else can switch topics simply by voicing a new line of  thought.  Points of dispute can be clarified.  Analyses can be deepened.   Proposals can be sharpened.  Stakeholders can express diverse perspectives.   At its best, open discussion can be very effective.  But in reality, most open  discussions are hard to sit through.  Sometimes the conversation meanders  or drifts.  Sometimes a few individuals dominate.  Sometimes people talk  past one another without even attempting to link their ideas to the previous  speaker’s statements.  All in all, the term “open discussion” is often a  synonym for “Groan Zone.” INTRODUCTION THE FACILITATOR’S TWO CENTRAL QUESTIONS    Community At Work  © 2007     77     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  A BASIC PROBLEM    When an open discussion is underway, many groups  have trouble determining whose turn it is to speak next.  Usually the  decision is left to individual members via the unspoken principle, “Speak up  whenever you have something you want to say.”  This principle may seem  reasonable, but in practice it often creates confusion and inequity.  Those  who think it is polite to wait for a lull in the conversation usually end up  waiting much longer than those who start talking whenever the current  speaker takes a breath.  Furthermore, those who are more assertive may be  seen by some as rude or domineering, while those who are more tentative  may be perceived as having fewer ideas to contribute.    STACKING    The technique of stacking is a highly effective yet easy-to-master   method for directing traffic.  To stack, a facilitator simply asks the group,  “Would you please raise your hand if you’d like to speak.”  Then, before  anyone actually begins speaking, the facilitator assigns a number to each  person.  “You’ll be first . . . You’re second . . . You’ll go third . . . ” and so on.   Whenever someone finishes speaking, the facilitator calls on the person next   in line:  “Who was third?  Was it you, Maria?  Okay, your turn – go ahead.”   After the stack is complete, the facilitator begins the next stack by asking,  “Does anyone else want to speak?  If so, please raise your hand now.” INTERRUPTING THE STACK    The problem with stacking is that it impedes  spontaneity – no one has the opportunity to make an immediate response to  someone else’s remarks.  No matter how provocative those remarks might  be, one must wait until the end of the current stack in order to raise one’s  hand and respond.  Many minutes could elapse, during which time other  comments might take the discussion down an entirely different path.  If the  facilitator observes a sudden flurry of hand waving or agitated body  language, these are indicators that people may feel more-than-usual pressure  to respond quickly to an important remark.  To handle this problem, the  facilitator can adopt a technique called interrupting the stack.  S/he can say,  “I’m going to interrupt the stack for a couple of minutes and let two or three  people respond to this last comment.  For those of you who are already in  line to speak, don’t worry.  I won’t forget about you.  I will definitely return  to the designated speaking order soon.”  Interrupting the stack allows a group to spontaneously intensify a discussion.   But it can also create the appearance of a facilitator who plays favorites.  To  prevent this a facilitator should, when first asking for raised hands, state that  s/he might interrupt the stack to permit a few responses to a hot topic.   ORGANIZING THE FLOW OF A DISCUSSION FACILITATING OPEN DISCUSSION   Community At Work  © 2007    78   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF STACKING    Facilitators who rely too  heavily on stacking often receive comments like these:  “I felt you were  being very fair and even-handed with us, but I wish you had done more to  help us stay focused.  There were too many different topics on the floor – I  couldn’t follow the discussion.”  Or, “I wanted us to be able to get deeper  into the meat of the controversy, and I felt you were too intent on having  everyone participate.  I would have liked it if two or three people could have  just debated each other for awhile.”   As these statements illustrate, stacking alone is not sufficient.  If overdone, it  can become tiresome.  But it is nonetheless a very important intervention.  Often it is stacking that enables a group to break habitual patterns of  deference and favoritism.  For example, stacking is sometimes the simplest  way to help a rigidly hierarchical group make room for participation from  low-status members.  In the final analysis, stacking is the clearest and the  most explicit – and therefore the most accessible – technique for organizing  the flow of an open discussion. THE PROBLEM    Not all groups benefit from stacking.  For example, some  groups have a fast-paced, almost competitive style of interacting.  For them,  stacking would seem artificial and forced.  As another example, stacking is too  structured for very small groups consisting of, say, three or four members.   Yet members of such groups may still need help knowing when they can  speak.  This problem becomes acute whenever the flow of discussion falls  under the spell of two or three high-participating speakers who are allowed  to dominate the proceedings.  At those times, a facilitator can use informal  methods to shift the focus away from the frequent contributors and create  opportunities for less frequent contributors to speak.  Four such methods –   encouraging, balancing, making space, and using the clock – are discussed next. ENCOURAGING    When using the technique of encouraging, a facilitator says,  “Who else wants to say something?” or “Could we hear from someone who  hasn’t talked for awhile?”  The assumption that underlies this technique is  that some people may need a nudge to speak up.  Encouraging is thus a  means of providing extra support to those who need it.  The entire group  can benefit from this intervention because it takes pressure off everyone.   Frequent participators are freed to speak without fear that their  contributions will overpower the others; infrequent participators feel invited  to offer their ideas without fear of appearing rude or aggressive. FACILITATING OPEN DISCUSSION INFORMAL TECHNIQUES FOR BROADENING PARTICIPATION   Community At Work  © 2007     79     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  FACILITATING OPEN DISCUSSION BALANCING    The technique of balancing is useful when most members of a  group appear reticent to disagree with the opinion of the person who has  just spoken.  For example, suppose a member of the group’s senior  management says, “Internal politics is not a problem here.  If your work has  merit, you will be rewarded appropriately.”  Using balancing, a facilitator  could say, “As we all know, there are many times when different people have  entirely different perspectives on the same situation.  In this case, there has  been a statement that internal politics is not a problem.  Does everyone see it  that way, or are there other points of view?”  Under less threatening  circumstances a facilitator can ask, simply, “What are some other ways of  looking at this?”  Or, “Does anyone have a different point of view?”  All of  these accomplish the same goal:  they lend some support to people who do  not agree with the mainstream point of view.    MAKING SPACE    The technique of making space involves questions or  supportive statements that are aimed at specific individuals.  For example, a  facilitator may say, “Frankie, you look as if you want to speak.  Do you?”   Or, “Leticia, did you have something you wanted to say?”   Of course, it’s always a bit dicey to call on people by name.  Many people do  not want to be singled out.  Thus, a facilitator should use this technique  sparingly – only when s/he sees a gesture that appears to mean, “May I  talk?” or “I have an opinion too.”  For example, some people lift their index finger without raising their hand.   Others raise their chin in a sort of reverse nod.  On occasion someone might  look directly at a facilitator and crinkle his nose or purse her lips, as if to say,  “No, I don’t agree with what was just said.”  These are nonverbal cues that  give a facilitator permission to invite a quiet member to speak.    USING THE CLOCK    The technique of using the clock involves statements like  these:  “We have five minutes left.  I want to make sure we’ve heard from  everyone who wants to speak, particularly those who haven’t had a chance  yet.  Who wants to speak?”  Or, “We have time for only one or two more  comments – perhaps we should hear from someone who hasn’t spoken for  awhile.”  These interventions communicate that the stakes have gone up a  little:  if you want to speak, now is your chance.  Another way of using the clock is aimed at situations when a few people have  become highly engaged in a conversation.  To give other members an  opportunity to participate, a facilitator can say, “We still have more than  fifteen minutes left in this discussion.  How about if we hear from someone  who hasn’t spoken for awhile?”    Community At Work  © 2007    80   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    FACILITATING OPEN DISCUSSION HELPING INDIVIDUALS  MAKE THEIR POINTS PARAPHRASING AND MIRRORING    Through the use of reflective listening  techniques, a facilitator can help a speaker feel understood.  This keeps the  focus of attention on the individual who was just speaking, but the  facilitator does not push the speaker for any particular behavior.  The  speaker is left to his or her own judgment to decide whether to continue  talking or stop.       When a facilitator engages in paraphrasing and mirroring, it is important to do  it for as many participants as possible.  Otherwise, some people will wonder  why the facilitator seems to be playing favorites. But continual reflective listening during an open discussion can become  tiresome and annoying.  It slows down the pace and interferes with  spontaneity.  Therefore, many facilitators reserve the use of paraphrasing and  mirroring during an open discussion primarily for times when the need for  support is obvious –  for example, when a speaker is having difficulty being  clear, or when two people are talking past one another.  Since the reflective  listening is being done during moments of obvious stress, participants are  not likely to perceive the intervention as indicating preferential treatment. DRAWING PEOPLE OUT    By asking questions or even by saying, simply,  “Can you say more about that?” the facilitator helps a speaker develop a line  of thought.  This supports the speaker to advance his or her own thinking  – for example, by making explicit an unstated assumption or hunch.        When a facilitator decides to draw someone out, he or she is in effect  making a judgment that it would benefit the group to hear more from the  person who has just been speaking.  In this way, the facilitator has a subtle  but very real influence over who gets how much airtime and whose ideas  will develop more, become better organized, better articulated, and  ultimately more accessible to other members.       Therefore, it is imperative that facilitators resist the temptation to draw out the  people whose ideas sound the most promising.  This would violate the cardinal  rule of impartiality; soon group members would suspect that the facilitator  had a hidden agenda.  Instead, a good rule of thumb is to draw someone out  only when that person’s ideas are hard to understand, regardless of whether  the ideas are interesting or realistic.    Community At Work  © 2007     81     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  FACILITATING OPEN DISCUSSION MANAGING DIVERGENT PERSPECTIVES  THE PROBLEM:  MULTIPLE FRAMES OF REFERENCE    Broad participation in a  discussion usually produces a divergence of perspectives.  This diversity can  cause serious misunderstandings.    EXAMPLE    The owner of several large parking garages met with his nine  managers to discuss a reorganization of duties that would take place in  another month, after automated ticket-payment machines were installed in  each garage.  Partway through the meeting, the owner raised the problem of  customers who lose their tickets.  He asked for suggestions.  Someone quickly  responded with an idea.  Someone else explained why that idea wouldn’t  work.  A third person then wondered if the cashiers would cooperate.  He  pointed out that many of the cashiers would realize that their jobs were in  jeopardy.  This speaker concluded by proposing that the whole idea of  payment by machine be reconsidered – perhaps even abandoned.  A fourth  person said she wasn’t in favor of abandoning the project, but she did have  some concerns about the reliability of the equipment.  She said, “Maybe we  could test the new equipment in one or two smaller locations and get the  bugs out of the system before the major installation.”  At this point, the  owner became impatient and scolded everyone for failing to stay on topic.   What the owner did not understand is that in a discussion like this one, each  person must approach the topic from his or her own individual frame of  reference.  The person who suggested considering the question from the  cashiers’ perspective was thinking out loud.  As he did so, he realized for the  first time that a layoff, with all its unpleasant consequences, might well be  forthcoming.  The person who suggested testing the equipment was  remembering her last job, where a computer system had been installed  without adequate preparation – causing a plunge in her company’s efficiency  and morale.  The owner clearly felt that his employees were doing something wrong.   Notwithstanding his feelings, however, the employees were not  misbehaving.  In fact, the opposite was true.  The employees were doing their best  to formulate their ideas.  Each person was working hard to answer the  question the owner had posed – but they were all working from their own  frames of reference.  They could not respond to the exhortation to stay on  topic; they felt they were on topic.   This is a perfect example of the  confusions that arise from the inevitable presence of divergent perspectives.    Community At Work  © 2007    82   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    TECHNIQUES FOR FOCUSING A DISCUSSION FACILITATING OPEN DISCUSSION THE FACILITATOR’S CHALLENGE    The parking garage discussion is an  example of a common challenge that many facilitators do not handle well.   It’s tempting to say something like, “It seems as if we’re getting off track,” or  “I think we should return to the topic of lost tickets.”  These interventions  sound good, but they are usually ineffective.  They tell participants, in effect,  “Don’t think from your own frame of reference.”   Everyone approaches a discussion from his or her own individual frame of  reference.  The meaning, the significance, and the priority of any given  point of view are all matters of interpretation.  And each participant arrives  with different instincts about such matters.  It’s essential for a facilitator to  recognize that this is not unhealthy.   The goal of a good discussion is to produce more harmony among  individually different perspectives – to reconcile the diversity through a  process of mutual understanding.  But many people seem to think that  participants in a discussion should start out with a shared framework.  When  they hear statements they consider to be tangential, they seek to solve the  problem of divergent perspectives through a process of persuasion or  control.  “That’s a side issue.”  “Let’s get back to the point.”  “Would  everyone please get focused?”  These statements may cause a speaker to stop  talking, but they certainly don’t help the speaker to feel understood.       The point is that people of goodwill can and do differ on such matters as  what’s important and what’s not; what’s on track and what’s off track;  what’s useful and what’s useless.  When these differences occur, discomfort  arises.  This is normal and healthy.  It means people are participating.  But  the discomfort can deepen – even to the point of ruining a group’s ability to  think together – when participants don’t realize that their individual frames  of reference are biasing their assessment of the value of one another’s  contributions.  At such times, people become impatient with one another:  they say things they regret, they stop listening, or they act childishly.  What can a facilitator do to prevent this deterioration?  Here are several  techniques that can be used effectively when a discussion has branched into  multiple lines of thought.   Pertinent skills are sequencing, calling for responses, deliberate refocusing,  tracking, asking for themes, and framing.    Community At Work  © 2007     83     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  FACILITATING OPEN DISCUSSION SEQUENCING IN ACTION    A group of teachers met monthly to discuss the  school’s curriculum.  Carter, a second-year teacher, made a controversial  statement.  Toni, the librarian, had a private reaction to that statement.  “I  hope Carter stops talking soon,” thought Toni.  “He’s going on a tangent,  and it’s wasting our time.”  But the next person to speak responded to  Carter’s points in earnest.  After a few minutes, Toni said, “Okay, folks, we  need to get this discussion back on track.”  Someone else then said, “Thanks,  Toni.  I, too, thought we’d drifted away from our topic.”  This was a critical  juncture.  Carter felt he had been put down.  Toni felt irritated and guilty.   Both stopped participating, and the meeting ended on a sour note.   If a facilitator had been present, a simple sequencing intervention might have  produced an entirely different result.  The facilitator could have intervened  at the critical juncture and said, “We appear to have two conversations going  on simultaneously.  Some of you want to respond to Carter’s statement.  At  the same time, others of you would prefer to return to the previous topic.  So  here’s what I’m going to do.  I’m going to take two or three more comments  on Carter’s statements, and then I’m going to ask Toni to reintroduce the  other line of thought.  We’ll spend at least a few minutes on that topic area.   Then, if necessary, we can take stock and see what seems most important to  focus on at that point.”    This example demonstrates how sequencing works:  (1) validate both  perspectives, (2) help the group pay attention to one line of thought for a  few minutes, and (3) help the group pay attention to a different line of  thought for the next few minutes. ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF SEQUENCING    When a facilitator   sequences two conversations that are underway simultaneously, s/he is   keeping a discussion focused without taking sides.  This intervention usually  earns a group’s appreciation.  By validating both perspectives, the facilitator  establishes a greater sense of safety for everyone.  By identifying and labeling  two separate lines of thought, the facilitator helps members keep track of  what is going on.  And by organizing the group’s participation – first a few  minutes on one idea, then a few minutes on the other – the facilitator  demonstrates that s/he can guide the group through the Groan Zone. But sequencing works only when there are two perspectives.   When a  discussion heads down three or four different tracks, as in the example of the  parking garage – the chances are great that the group would not appreciate  hearing the facilitator say, “First, we’ll spend a few minutes on idea A, then  we’ll shift to idea B, then we’ll go to idea C, and then to idea D.”  That  sequence would seem too controlled and too tedious to sit through.      Community At Work  © 2007    84   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    FACILITATING OPEN DISCUSSION CALLING FOR RESPONSES    At times a facilitator may say something like,  “Does anyone have a reaction to what Erin just said?”  Or, “After listening to  the previous three speakers, does anyone have any questions for them?”   Questions like these guide whoever speaks next to remain on the same track  as the person who has just spoken.  Calling for responses is thus a method for  preserving the focus of the discussion, even though it also encourages  participation from new speakers.   This technique has the same effect as drawing someone out:  the ideas that  receive a facilitator’s support are likely to be more fully discussed.  Yet since  the facilitator is asking for broader participation, this move is rarely opposed  or even distrusted.  Participants tend to view calling for responses as a neutral  effort to keep the discussion moving.  This tends to be true even when it is  apparent that the facilitator has made a choice between two or more topics.   So long as a facilitator makes the choice in good faith – not for the sake of  favoring certain ideas but rather to keep the discussion balanced – most  group members will give the facilitator the benefit of the doubt. DELIBERATE REFOCUSING   A facilitator deliberately refocuses the  conversation by saying things like, “For the past ten minutes, you have been  discussing topic ABC.  But some of you indicated that you wanted the group  to discuss topic DEF too.  Is now a good time to switch?”  Or, “A while ago  Robin raised an issue, but no one responded.  Before we lose that thought  altogether, I just want to check:  Does anyone have a comment for Robin?”   As these examples illustrate, deliberate refocusing is another method for  keeping the discussion balanced.  Rather than permit one content area to  dominate, the facilitator refocuses the conversation in order to provide fair  opportunities for other issues.  One of the most effective, and least offensive,  occasions for deliberate refocusing is when a group has allowed two or three  speakers to monopolize the discussion for several minutes or longer.    Of all the techniques described here, deliberate refocusing is the most  directive.  It pushes people to move away from one track of discussion and  move onto another track, at the same time as it encourages everyone to  move their attention away from one set of speakers and give their attention  to a different set of speakers.  Accordingly, the bias that is built into this  technique is more noticeable.  When a facilitator refocuses a discussion s/he  runs the risk of being perceived as non-neutral – as choosing to cut off  discussion perhaps before the group has completed a train of thought.   Therefore, it is recommended that this technique be used sparingly.     Community At Work  © 2007     85     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  TRACKING    As illustrated by the case of the parking garage managers, open  discussions often branch into several distinct subconversations.  Tracking  means keeping track of those various lines of thought.  A facilitator tracks by  saying things like, “I think you are discussing several issues at the same time.   Here they are. . . ”  Then s/he identifies each track.  Thus, a facilitator might  have said to the parking garage managers, “I think you are discussing four  issues.  First:  How to deal with customers who lose tickets.  Second:  Will  cashiers cooperate?  Third:  Should you reconsider the very idea of payment  by machines?  Fourth:  Concern about the reliability of the equipment.”    Tracking is valuable when a discussion is at its most competitive and its most  unruly –  when people are least likely to be listening to each other.  These are  precisely the times when directive methods like sequencing don’t work.   When everyone is intent on pushing individual agendas, suggestions by the  facilitator are hard to hear and respond to.  At such times, a facilitator must  refrain from prioritizing or structuring the discussion.  Instead, he or she  remains neutral and alert to the necessity for supporting every speaker.   Tracking reassures everyone that at least someone is listening.  COMPLETING A TRACKING INTERVENTION    After showing a group the  themes they have been discussing, how should a facilitator complete the  intervention?  The most effective method is to ask for accuracy and then do  no more.  Ask, “Have I captured all the themes?”  Someone may answer,  “No!  You missed my ideas.”  If so, correct the omission, and finish with a  summary.  “So there you are – discussing five topics all at once.”  Then stop.   A COMMON MISTAKE OF TECHNIQUE    Many facilitators are tempted to  complete a tracking intervention by asking,  “Which topic would you like to  focus on now?”  But it is nearly impossible for a group to answer that  question.  Typically, the members then go into a tailspin as they dicker over  the most suitable focus, becoming mired in talking about what to talk about.    If a facilitator refrains from asking what people want to focus on, a group  generally responds to a tracking intervention in one of two ways.  The most  common response is an integrative one.  Someone combines a few of the  tracks named by the facilitator and makes a clever proposal or offers an  insightful analysis or raises a provocative question.  In other words, someone  integrates and advances the group’s thinking.  The other response is a  persistent one:  someone returns to his or her pet theme.  At times the  members will follow that person’s lead, in which case the group has created  its new focus – at least temporarily.  At other times a quarrel ensues: “I don’t  want to talk about that issue now.”  In those cases the facilitator can be an  honest broker and propose a simple sequence.  “Can we spend a few minutes  on this issue, then shift to some of the other themes?”  FACILITATING OPEN DISCUSSION    Community At Work  © 2007    86   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    FACILITATING OPEN DISCUSSION ASKING FOR THEMES    This technique is quite similar to tracking, with one  major difference:  the lines of thought are identified by group members, not  by the facilitator.  To ask for themes, a facilitator first says, “You are now  discussing several issues, all at the same time,” and then asks, “Can anyone  identify any of the themes or topic areas currently being discussed?”  As  people call out their responses, the facilitator writes them on a flipchart.   When people have finished listing themes, the facilitator can say, “Now let’s  return to open discussion and see what happens in the next few minutes.  If  necessary, we’ll come back to this list and structure it more.  But we might be  able to skip that step altogether.  Let’s find out.  Does anyone have any  comments about any of these themes?”  As with tracking, the next response  will probably be either an integrative response or a persistent one. FRAMING    As with the two preceding interventions, the facilitator begins by  pointing out that several subconversations are underway.  The facilitator  then says, “Let’s remember how this discussion began.”  S/he then restates  the discussion’s original purpose.  For example, “Originally, Susan asked for  input into next month’s agenda.  The conversation has now branched out in  several directions.  Some might be important to pursue right now; perhaps  others can be deferred.  Which ones do you think are relevant?”  The  remaining steps are the same ones taken when a facilitator asks for themes.   Record the group’s answers, then return the group to open discussion. FURTHER PROCESS MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS TOLERATING SILENCES    A typical silence during an open discussion lasts  about three to five seconds.  A painfully long silence lasts ten or fifteen  seconds.  Those silences mean that people are thinking.  For example, people  may need a few seconds to form an analysis of a complex problem.  Or in a  tense meeting, participants might become quiet while they search for tactful  ways to express difficult feelings.  Silence is not dysfunctional; it occurs  when participants turn inward.  Yet some facilitators find it exceedingly hard  to tolerate silences of those lengths.  This has little to do with the needs of  the group.  Rather, it reflects the facilitator’s own discomfort with silence.    To discern your level of discomfort, ask a friend to help with this experiment.     During a conversation, say, “Okay, let’s be quiet now.”  Allow five seconds to  elapse.  Now discuss how that felt.  Repeat the experiment with a lapse time  of fifteen seconds.  Tolerating silence is like any other skill – it is acquired  through practice.  Let someone else break the silences in your conversations.     Community At Work  © 2007     87     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  SWITCHING FROM OPEN DISCUSSION TO A DIFFERENT FORMAT    When a  discussion becomes tedious and people appear to be restless or bored, the  wisest choice might be to end the open discussion and switch to another  format.  Alternative formats include working in small groups, individual  writing, listing ideas without discussion, structured go-arounds, and many  more.  These are discussed in great detail in Chapter 7.  INTRODUCING AN OPEN DISCUSSION    When a facilitator works with a group  for the first time, s/he should briefly explain his or her approach so they can  cooperate with it.  Unusual interventions like stacking and interrupting the  stack require more explanation than self-evident ones like sequencing. Here is a sample of an effective introduction:  “We’re about to spend half an  hour in open discussion.  Since we haven’t done this before, I want to tell  you how I work.  I see an open discussion as a free-flowing opportunity for  an interchange of ideas between each participant and the entire group.  My  basic plan, therefore, is to stay out of your way so you can talk to each other. “If more than one person wants to talk at the same time, I’ll ask you to raise  hands and I’ll number you off.  That way, you’ll know when your turn is  coming and you won’t have to keep waving your hand to get my attention.   Once in a while, if someone makes a statement that produces immediate  reactions, I might take a few comments from people who weren’t in line to  speak.  But I’ll do that only when it’s an obvious choice.  And if I do let  anyone take a cut, I will definitely return to those who were in line.” That introduction takes roughly a minute to deliver – perhaps even a minute  and a half.  That’s a long time for a facilitator to be speaking.  But unless s/he  explains the approach, the group may not be capable of cooperating. FACILITATING OPEN DISCUSSION Open discussion is the most common of all the formats for thinking in  groups.  But without strong facilitation, an open discussion can become  tedious, frustrating, and ultimately nonproductive.  Harnessing a group’s  potential to work productively in this format depends to a large degree on  the facilitator’s mastery of the participatory techniques described in this  chapter.

For example: “First, we should  talk about the budget.  Then we should focus on our hiring policy.   After that, we can resume work on next year’s training plan.”   This illustrates a prevalent mind-set about process:  that the process of a  meeting is the same thing as the sequence of topics that will be covered at  that meeting.  “We’ll begin with Topic 1 and we’ll work on it until we  finish with that topic.  Then we’ll move to Topic 2 and work on that  until we’re done with it.  Then we’ll go on to Topic 3.”  A GE ND A F OR  A  M EE T IN G BEGINNING of TOPIC    END of TOPIC TOPIC 1: BUDGET REVIEW BEGINNING of TOPIC    END of TOPIC TOPIC 2: HIRING POLICY BEGINNING of TOPIC TOPIC 3: TRAINING  PLAN    END of TOPIC BEGINNING of MEETING    END of MEETING  TIME     Community At Work  © 2007     91     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  PROCESS DESIGN, BY DEFAULT When a topic is introduced at a meeting, most groups automatically slip  into a discussion.  And they typically continue having the discussion  until they come to the end of that topic – at which point they move to  the next topic and begin another discussion.   Although there are many valid reasons for engaging in a discussion, it is  also important to recognize the limitations.  As a process, open discussion  puts a lot of performance pressure on participants.  One might think  that it would encourage spontaneity and interaction.  But in reality, it  encourages participation from the fastest, the smartest, and the most  confident members, while inhibiting participation from everyone else.

As the diagram makes  clear, open discussion is one approach to structuring participation in a  group, and there are many others.  Taken as a set, the various  approaches are called participation formats. Note that the topic – our hiring policy – stays the same from one  activity to the next.  It is the participation format that keeps changing. Each participation format has its own distinctive ground rules.  For  example, when building a list, a group must suspend judgment and call  out items with no discussion.  (The ground rules of most common  participation formats are described in this chapter and in Chapter 9.)   Obviously, different ground rules encourage different group behavior.   Therefore, a facilitator can shift a group’s behavior (and by extension,  the group’s energy) every time s/he shifts the participation format.

These subgroup formats are crucial for keeping everyone’s battery  charged. Shifting back and forth – sometimes working in the whole group and  sometimes working in subgroups of various size – is truly a “best  practice” for facilitators to utilize.  Although it seems almost too basic to  take seriously, the fact is that this underlying structure will significantly  improve the perceived quality of a meeting.

The tight structure of the activities assists  people in preserving their focus and staying clear about the short-term  objectives of their participation.  And the variety supports people to  maintain their energy.    Furthermore, your group will have a continuing experience of starting  something and finishing it: starting and finishing; starting and  finishing; starting and finishing.  As the group accomplishes one step  and moves on to the next, this is how momentum builds. Learning when and how to use a variety of participation formats is the  focus of this chapter.

Ironically, open discussion and  presentations and reports are the two formats that place the most pressure on  people to appear polished and conclusive when they speak.  By contrast, the  other formats give people latitude to do rough-draft thinking.   PARTICIPATION FORMATS Small Groups Individual Writing Open Discussion Presentations and Reports Jigsaw Listing Ideas Fishbowls Scrambler Multi-Tasking Tradeshow Structured Go-Arounds Roleplays    Community At Work  © 2007    96   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    LISTING IDEAS Searching for a better understanding of the causes or elements  of a problem.  When a problem is more complicated than it  originally appeared, use idea-listing to explore questions  like, “What’s really going on here?” or “What are some  influences we have not yet considered?” 33.. 22.. Showing the members of a polarized group that there are  actually more than two competing opinions in the room.   Listing ideas will draw out a wide range of thoughts on a  given topic.  This tends to happen even when there is a  polarized, us-versus-them atmosphere in the group. Generating a list of innovative or unconventional solutions to  a difficult problem. 44.. Bringing a large group back together after people have been  working in small groups.  Listing ideas is the fastest way to  collect the fruits of their various discussions.  The group  then has more time to go into depth on topics of interest. 55.. Providing structure when a topic feels overwhelming, unwieldy,  or out of control.  By listing ideas, participants can see the  breadth of the whole group’s thinking.  The list creates a  basis for sorting and prioritizing the elements they want to  tackle first.  Thus, listing ideas is often an important first  step in reducing the complexity of a difficult task. 66.. RECOMMENDED USES Jump-starting a discussion.  Listing ideas will help a group  to rapidly identify many aspects of the subject, even  when they’re just beginning to think about it. 11..    Community At Work  © 2007     97     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  LISTING IDEAS Hang large sheets of paper on the wall. 11.. Explain the ground rules for suspending judgment: • Anyone may put anything on the list that seems relevant. • Suspend judgment.  No arguing or criticizing permitted. • No discussion while the listing is underway.  Ideas can be  discussed later, after the list has been built. 33.. Ask for a volunteer to serve as the chartwriter. The job of the chartwriter is to write down everyone’s  ideas without censoring or improving anything. 22.. State the group’s task in the form of a question.  For example,  “What are our options for reducing our budget?” 44.. Give a time estimate for the activity, and have the group begin. 55.. PROCEDURE Have people call out ideas one at a time. • Honor everything everyone says. • Use mirroring as often as possible. • Summarize complex sentences for the chartwriter. • If anyone begins arguing or discussing an item, politely  remind the whole group of the ground rules. 66.. 88.. Toward the end of the allotted time, announce, “Two more  minutes.”  This often produces one final burst of ideas. 77.. Don’t panic when the pace slows down.  It usually means  people are thinking, now that the obvious ideas have been  said.  Tolerate silences.  If you push for more ideas, many  people will feel pressured and stop thinking altogether.    Community At Work  © 2007    98   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    Brainwriting Members write ideas on  individual sheets of paper.   Every few minutes, people  trade sheets, read them,  and add fresh ideas.  Listing ideas can be done in various ways, all of which elicit divergent thinking.   Using these variations  keeps the process fresh and interesting. Note that although there are clear differences in the specific procedures associated  with each approach, suspended judgment remains the enduring grounding principle. Brainstorming Creative ideas – particularly  those that are silly, oddball,  or impossible – are eagerly  encouraged.  Quantity is  more important than quality. Listing Ideas: Standard  Approach A group generates answers  to a question.  Ideas are  recorded on flipcharts. All ideas are acceptable. LISTING  IDEAS:  VARIATIONS Using Sticky Notes Members write ideas on  stickies, one idea per  sheet.  All stickies are  posted on a wall.  Later,  ideas can be categorized. Multi-Topic, Multi-Station Flipcharts on different topics  are posted around the room.   Members may begin at any  station.  They move to new  ones every few minutes. Small Group Jump-Start Have members form pairs  and discuss a question.  Then reconvene the group  to build a list of good ideas.    Community At Work  © 2007     99     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  STRUCTURED GO-AROUNDS RECOMMENDED USES 11.. Opening a meeting.  A structured go-around (also known as a  “round robin”) is an excellent way to begin a meeting of  ninety minutes or longer.  It breaks the ice and affirms the  value that everyone’s participation is welcome and expected. 22.. Structuring a complex discussion.  During open discussion,  there are often several subconversations going on  simultaneously.  A structured go-around acknowledges  this fact, and allows each person’s pet topic to become  the focus of group attention for a brief period of time. 33.. Making room for quiet members.  A go-around supports  those who have trouble breaking into conversations. Compensating for differences in status and rank.   A go-around provides equal time to all participants,  regardless of the degree of their authority in the group.   55.. 66.. Returning from a break after a heated disagreement.  After any  disturbing episode, a break followed by a go-around is an  ideal method for allowing everyone to voice reactions to  what occurred before the break. 44.. Gathering diverse perspectives when the membership consists of varied interest groups.  Go-arounds restrain members from  arguing about the validity of each other’s frames of reference. 77.. Closing a meeting.  This gives each member a final chance to  express thoughts and feelings that might otherwise not be  spoken – at least, not in front of everyone.    Community At Work  © 2007    100   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    PROCEDURE Give people an idea of how much time to take.  Example 1:   “This will work best if each of you spends about a minute  sharing your reactions.”  Example 2:  “Take as much time  as you like to give your impressions of why this problem  keeps reappearing.” 66.. Have group members pull their chairs together to form a circle  or a semicircle.  It is important in a go-around that every  member see every other member’s face. 11.. Give a one-sentence overview of the topic to be addressed.   Example:  “In a moment, we’ll each have a chance to give  our reactions to the presentation we just heard.” 22.. Explain the process.  Example:  “We’ll go clockwise from  whoever speaks first.  While someone is talking, no one  may interrupt.  When you’re through speaking, say ‘pass’  or ‘I’m done,’ so the person next to you knows when to  begin his or her turn.” 33.. If there are specific variations in the ground rules, go over  them now.  For example, a facilitator might sometimes  decide to give participants explicit permission to pass  without speaking when it is their turn. 44.. After clarifying the ground rules, restate the topic.  People often  forget the topic when they are focusing on your review of  the ground rules.  Now is the time to remind them and  provide a more detailed explanation, if necessary. 55.. STRUCTURED GO-AROUNDS    Community At Work  © 2007     101     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  Talking Stick A member picks up the  talking stick, then speaks  from the heart.  No one  else may speak until the  stick has been set down. Two or Three Feeling Words People end a meeting  with two or three feeling  words that describe the  mood.  (Example: “I’m  tired but happy.”) These are all variations of the basic go-around.  They all have two ground  rules in common:  (1) one person speaks at a time, and (2) the speaker  indicates when s/he’s done speaking – for example, by saying “pass.”   All of the variations encourage and equalize participation. Seven Words or Less People end a meeting  with no more than seven  words. Incomplete  sentences are fine.  Popcorn Everyone takes a turn  whenever they choose.    When most have spoken,  the facilitator asks, “Who  still hasn’t had a turn?” Toss the Beanbag When the speaker is  done, s/he tosses an  object (an eraser, for  example) to someone  else, who speaks next. The Standard Structured Go-Around Go clockwise – or  counterclockwise – from  whoever speaks first. GO-AROUND VARIATIONS    Community At Work  © 2007    102   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    Breaking the ice — making it feel safer to participate.  People  feel less reticent in small groups, which seem less public. 11.. Deepening everyone’s understanding of a topic.  In small  groups, people have more time to explore and develop  their own ideas.   33.. Exploring different aspects of an issue quickly.  Small  groups can work on several components of a single  problem simultaneously.  This use of small groups is  efficient, effective, and quite common. 44.. Building relationships.  Small groups provide more  opportunity for people to get to know one another  personally. 55.. Greater commitment to the outcome.  Small groups support  more participation.  More participation means more  opportunity to influence the outcome.  When the  outcome incorporates everyone’s thinking, participants  have a deeper understanding of its logic and nuance, and  they are more likely to feel committed to its effective  implementation.  This is what is meant by “ownership”  of the outcome. 66.. 22.. Keeping the energy up.  It’s physically energizing to get out  of a chair and move around.  Furthermore, working in  small groups allows everyone to talk.  Active involvement  energizes people. RECOMMENDED USES WORKING IN SMALL GROUPS    Community At Work  © 2007     103     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  Wait until everyone has formed their small groups before  giving further instructions. 33.. PROCEDURE After everyone has settled down, clarify the task at hand.   State the topic people will be discussing; then state the  expected outcome.  Example:  “Dr. Stone claimed that  married managers and single managers are treated very  differently.  Do you agree?  What has your experience  been?  See if each of you can come up with two or three  examples that have arisen at your place of work.” 44.. If you have any instructions about specific ground rules or  procedures, give them now.  Example:  “One person should  be ‘the speaker’ while the other person is ‘the listener.’   Then reverse roles when I give the signal.” 55.. As the process unfolds, announce the time remaining.   Example:  “Three more minutes!”  When time is almost up,  give a final warning:  “Just a few more seconds.” 77.. 22.. Tell the participants how to find partners for their small groups.   Examples:  “Turn to the person next to you,” or “Find two  people you don’t know very well.” Tell people how much time has been allotted for this activity. 66.. 11.. Give a one sentence overview of the purpose of the next task.   Example:  “Now we’re going to discuss our reactions to  Dr. Stone’s last lecture.”  Leave the instructions vague for  now.  (Clarify them in Step 4.) BREAKING INTO SMALL GROUPS 88.. Reconvene the large group by asking a few people to share  their thoughts and learnings.    Community At Work  © 2007    104   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    There are many more ways to work in small groups than most facilitators realize.   Variety prevents boredom and keeps people wondering what will come next. Talk, Then Switch • Two participants. • One talker, one listener. • Switch roles at a set time. • Often brief: 5 to 8 minutes. Two Rounds or More • Two participants. • Round one: talk, then switch.  • Round two: repeat sequence. • Typically 10 to15 minutes. 2 – 4 – 2 • Four participants. • Round one: two pairs.  • Round two: all four people.  • Round three: two new pairs. • Typically 15 to 20 minutes. Casual Conversation • Two or more participants. • Informality prevails. • Usually brief: 3 to 7 minutes. 2 – 4 – 8 • Eight participants. • Round one: four pairs.  • Round two: two foursomes.  • Round three: group of eight. • Typically 20 to 30 minutes. SMALL GROUP VARIATIONS • Three or more participants. • Objective: skillbuilding. • One person observes silently  while others do an activity. • Observer gives feedback  when activity concludes. Activity with Feedback  Breakout Groups • Any number of participants.  • Objective: make significant  headway on a task. • Chartwriting adds value. • Often 30 to 45 minutes. Speed Dating • Two participants. • Objective: explore diversity. • Casual conversation. • Switch partners at a set time. • Typically 15 to 30 minutes. Cocktail Party  • Temporary groupings. •  Objective: informal  discussion of key themes. • Participants mill about.  • Typically 20 to 30 minutes. Buddy System • Two or three participants.  • Partners remain together  while activities change.  • Can last all day. MORE SMALL GROUP VARIATIONS    Community At Work  © 2007     105     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  USING SMALL GROUPS  FOR MULTI-TASKING 1.  Divide the group into breakout  groups (i.e., committees) and assign  a different task to each.  For  example, suppose the group is  planning a conference.  They might  divide into three breakout groups.   One makes a list of people to invite;  a second group lists topics to  discuss; and a third identifies  logistics to handle. 2. Have each breakout group select  people to play needed roles, such as   presenter, discussion leader, and  recorder. 3. Specify the time limit for working  in committee.  Then begin.  Give a  10-minute warning before ending. 4. Reconvene the large group.  Ask for  a report from each breakout group.    Allow 5 to 10 minutes for questions. BREAKOUT GROUPS THE GALLERY TOUR 1.  Divide the group into breakout  groups.   2. Give flipcharts and markers to each  breakout group and send them to  their “stations.”  These could be in  separate rooms, or in different  corners of the same room.  Have  every breakout group record their  work on flipcharts and post the  charts on nearby walls. 3. When time is up, reconvene the  large group.  Now form “tour  groups.”  Each tour group should  have at least one member from  every breakout group. 4. Tell the groups to take a 7 to 10  minute tour of each station.  Have  someone from each breakout group  explain the charts from that group.     Community At Work  © 2007    106   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    Allowing group members to collect their thoughts and feelings  after tempers have flared.  When emotions go out of  control, people can benefit from taking five minutes to  write about the hurt and anger they may be feeling. 55.. Preserving anonymity.  People may hesitate to speak freely  when their superiors or subordinates are present, or when  they fear other group members will disapprove of their  comments.  Sometimes members are more willing to share  their thoughts when they can submit them anonymously. 33.. 22.. Reflecting privately on something unusual or noteworthy that  happened recently in the group. Helping people remain engaged when the discussion has bogged  down.  Individual writing gives participants a break from  the interpersonal intensity of group dynamics, while  allowing them to keep working on the issues at hand.  44.. Giving members a chance to collect their thoughts in  preparation for open discussion. 11.. 77.. Providing input to a sponsor or decision-maker who does not  attend the meeting. 66.. Producing a first draft of a written product, such as a letter or a mission statement.  In this use of individual writing, each  person writes a rough-draft version of the product.  Then,  those who like what they’ve written can share their drafts  with the group. 88.. Evaluating a meeting when time is scarce but constructive  criticism is needed. RECOMMENDED USES INDIVIDUAL WRITING    Community At Work  © 2007     107     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  Give an overview of the task.  For example, “We’re going to  take five minutes writing our thoughts about the problems  with our performance review process.” 11 .. Wait until everyone has settled in. 33 .. 22 .. Ask everyone to take out a pen and paper.  (Note:  Bring  extra pens and paper.  It’s surprising how many people  don’t bring writing materials to meetings.) 44 .. Give detailed instructions about the task.  For example,  “Many people are not satisfied with our performance  review process.  Your task is to clarify specifically what  you don’t like about it.  First, write two or three problems  with the policy as it now stands.  Then, write about the  ways you have been adversely affected by that policy.” 77 .. Give a one-minute warning when time is almost up. 66 .. Let people know how much time has been allotted for  individual writing.  Then begin. 88 .. When time runs out, reconvene the group.  Allow ample time  for discussion of the material that was generated during  the writing period. PROCEDURE 55 .. Let people know whether they will be expected to show their  work to someone else.  It is reassuring to say, “You won’t  have to show this to anyone.  This is intended solely to  help you clarify your own thinking.” INDIVIDUAL WRITING    Community At Work  © 2007    108   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    IMPROVING PRESENTATIONS AND REPORTS PROBLEM SOLUTION Disorganized, complicated  reports that group members  cannot follow. Encourage the presenter to take a few  minutes ahead of time to think  through the logic of his or her report. Confusion about what the  listeners are expected to do  with information presented. Encourage the presenter to tell people  what s/he expects them to do with  the information afterward. Presenters keep talking while  handing out written materials.   Participants stop listening in  order to look over the handouts. Advise the presenter to pause while  people look over the material being  distributed.  Or wait until the report  is done before distributing handouts. Reports that barrage the  listeners with details, causing  people to get overloaded and  shut down. Encourage the presenter to use simple  visual aids and replace details with  diagrams.  Hand-drawn flipcharts often  work better than PowerPoint slides. People react to a report with a  dazed and uncomprehending  look, as though it made no sense. Ask the presenter to set aside time  for questions and answers.  Then  facilitate an actual Q&A session. Group members do not appear  to understand the report’s  central point. Encourage the presenter to state the  most important point in the first few  sentences, then restate it as summary. Tedious, rambling, repetitive  reports. Have the presenter jot down key  points on paper before speaking. People sit passively through a  PowerPoint slide presentation,  with no indication of reactions. Break up the presentation with  periods of high-engagement activitiy,  such as small group discussions.    Community At Work  © 2007     109     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING       Tradeshow is an audience-friendly  method of presenting information to a  group.  It is useful whenever at least  three speakers are expected to make  consecutive presentations that will  each run 15 minutes or longer.     Normally multiple speakers give their  presentations to the entire audience,  sequentially. With Tradeshow, speakers  present to subgroups simultaneously.    In this format, audience members  rotate to a new speaker’s station after a  set time has elapsed.  Speakers then  repeat their talk to the new arrivals.      Tradeshow has several benefits. The    smaller group size enables more  participation and deeper discussion.   And walking from station to station is  energizing; it counteracts the mind- numbing effect of “presentation  overload.” INSTRUCTIONS 1.  In advance, identify locations where  different speakers can create stations  for their presentations.  Each speaker  should have his or her own station. 2.  At the scheduled time, send presenters  to their stations.  Then send group  members to stations.  Send an equal  number of participants to each station. 3.  Have speakers give their presentations  for a set time, followed by questions  and/or discussion, also for a set time.  4. When time runs out, have everyone  leave their stations and go to new ones.   (Clockwise rotations work well.) 5.  Have speakers repeat the same  presentation to their new audiences. 6.  Repeat steps 3 to 5 as often as  necessary, so that all participants have  heard all presentations. 7.  Reconvene the whole group to debrief. DESCRIPTION TRADESHOW    Community At Work  © 2007    110   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    ROLEPLAYS INSTRUCTIONS 1.  Start by explaining the purpose of the  roleplay.  For example, “This activity  will help us gain insight into some  communication problems between  managers and employees.” 2.  Break into small groups. 3. Assign a role to each participant, and  provide some background to bring  that role to life.  For example, “Your  boss gave you an impossible task and  you were afraid to challenge him.” 4.  Give any specific instructions that  might be needed.  For example, “In  this roleplay, you must explain why  you did not finish the task, to a boss  who may react defensively.” 4.  Clarify the time limits.  Then begin. 5.  When finished, reconvene the large  group, and debrief the activity. A roleplay starts with a fabricated  scenario, which then unfolds over  the course of 15 to 20 minutes.   Among its beneficial uses are these:   participants can test “what if” ideas;  they can try out new skills;  or they  can put themselves in the shoes of  characters they’re roleplaying, thus  gaining insight and compassion.  Roleplays should not be designed too  elaborately.  They are  effective only  when everyone has a shared  understanding of how the activity is  going to work, and why.  Clear role  definitions and a clear explanation of  the plot line are essential to success. On the other hand, rigid roles set up  participants to run out of ideas, and  become goofy or overly aggressive.   To prevent this common problem,  give everyone permission to change  their minds as the roleplay unfolds. DESCRIPTION    Community At Work  © 2007     111     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  FISHBOWLS INSTRUCTIONS 1.  Introduce the activity by explaining  its purpose.  For example (to a group  of government officials, service  providers, and community activists),  “This activity will help you better  understand each other’s priorities and  challenges without getting tangled up  in debate.” 2.  Invite one stakeholder group to be “in  the fishbowl.”  Seat them in a circle  in the center of the room.   3. Ask those in the fishbowl to discuss a  given issue.  Set a time limit.  Ask all  others to remain quiet and listen. 4. When time is up, allow everyone to  make comments and ask questions.   Optional:  Ask those who were in the  fishbowl to report on how it felt. 5. Bring the next stakeholder group into  the fishbowl, and repeat the process. DESCRIPTION      Fishbowls are done to help build  mutual understanding among  people whose backgrounds or jobs  are significantly different.  For  example, a fishbowl might help  doctors, nurses, and managers to  understand each other’s viewpoints.       For a set amount of time,  one group  (for example, the nurses) sits  together in the center of the room  and talks among themselves, while  others listen in on the discussion.   When time is up, a brief whole- group conversation ensues.  Then a  new group moves into the fishbowl.      In this way, like-minded  participants are afforded a time- limited opportunity to publicly  discuss an issue without needing to  defend their thoughts against  competing perspectives.    Community At Work  © 2007    112   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    SCRAMBLER   Scrambler is a way to organize a  small-group activity so that  participants can work with many  different partners within the frame  of that single activity.      The key is to break the activity into  rounds.  Upon completion of each  round, the members of each  subgroup separate from one another  and form new subgroups.   To avoid chaos, the instructions  should give participants a clear way  to find new partners.  Best practice is  to send one person clockwise to the  next station, while another goes  counterclockwise.  Have the third  person remain seated.  If the activity  is designed for more than three  participants per subgroup, send  people two stations to the left, two  to the right, and so on.  DESCRIPTION  INSTRUCTIONS 1.  Form groups of three.  Then have  eveyone number off (#1... #2... #3...)  within their small groups. 2.  Assign roles, describe the activity in  suitable detail, and let the action  begin. 3.  When time is up, ask everyone who  is a #1 to stand up.  Send them  clockwise to the next group. 4.  Now ask the #2s to stand.  Send them  counterclockwise to the next group. 5.  All #3s remain in place. 6.  Repeat Step 2, reassigning new roles  to each individual.  For example, if  the #1s were listeners before, this  time the #2s would be listeners. 7.  Repeat Steps 4 to 7 once more. 8.  Reconvene the group, and debrief.    Community At Work  © 2007     113     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  JIGSAW      Jigsaw is a small-group procedure that  allows multiple stakeholders to spend  time first with members who share  their interests, and then with members  who may have different priorities –  thus influencing and being influenced  by all points of view.     The activity begins with the whole  group identifying key themes that are  relevant to the topic at hand.       Participants then break up into  interest  groups with others who share their  interest.   After time has elapsed, everyone  reorganizes into jigsaw groups, which  are composed of representatives from  the various interest groups.      In jigsaw groups they report and discuss  key ideas that arose during the work  done in the interest groups. DESCRIPTION INSTRUCTIONS 1.  Define the topic to be worked on.  2.  Have participants distill the topic  into themes that interest them. 3.  Have everyone form small groups  based on their interest areas.  Give  these interest groups a relevant task,  such as, “Discuss the issues you find  most challenging.”   4. When a set time runs out, have  everyone form jigsaw groups.  Each  jigsaw group should contain one   representative from each interest  group.  For example, if there were five  interest groups, each jigsaw group  would have five members. 6.  In jigsaw groups, report on discussions  that took place in the interest groups.   Further discussion is optional. 7.  Reconvene the whole group, and  debrief the activity.    Community At Work  © 2007    114   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    1.  The Task: 2. The Outcome: 3. The Process: 4. The Rationale: 5. The Expected Time: “Here’s what we’re going to do...” “This is what we’ll have when we’re done...” “Here’s how we’ll do it...” “Here’s why we’re using this process ...” “Here’s how long this will take ...” SETTING THE FRAME • • – COMMUNITY AT WORK – When a facilitator introduces a new activity, some group members may  not fully understand what they’re being asked to do, or why.  To help  participants see the whole picture, a facilitator can effectively set the  frame by following the five steps shown above.     Community At Work  © 2007     115     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  1.  Before starting, select a question from the following list.       All such questions work equally well.   Now that [the given activity] is complete,     •  How did this go for you?     •  What have you learned?     •  What concerns has this raised for you?     •  What feelings did this bring up for you?     •  What are you noticing about this group?     •  What do you think of our prospects for success?     •  Have you heard anything  fresh and new?     •  How do you react to hearing so many different points of view? 2. Ask for a few participants to respond to the chosen question.   Alternatively, have a go-around so everyone can respond. 3. Upon completion of Step 2, proceed to the next item on the agenda.   Alternatively, have the group discuss, “Where do we go from here?”   Structured activities, like listing ideas or breaking into small groups,   usually produce a wide range of perspectives.  At the completion of a  structured activity, it is usually worthwhile to provide time for  reflecting on the discussion as a whole.  For example, people might  make observations like, “I never realized that there were so many  different ways of looking at this issue!” or, “Now I’m starting to  understand why this is such a problem.” This step is particularly important when people have been working in  separate groups.  It  creates an immediate context for resuming work  together, thus restoring the group's integrity as a single entity.  WHY   HOW  DEBRIEFING A STRUCTURED ACTIVITY   117 THE THEORY AND TECHNIQUE OF SUSPENDED JUDGMENT ➧  The Cost of Premature Criticism ➧  Suspended Judgment  ➧  Ground Rules for Brainstorming ➧  Facilitator’s Do’s and Don’ts     for Brainstorming ➧  The Many Uses of Brainstorming BRAINSTORMING88    Community At Work  © 2007    118   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    THE COST OF PREMATURE CRITICISM Rough-draft thinking is just like rough-draft writing:  it needs encouragement,  not evaluation.  Many people don’t understand this.  If they notice a flaw in  someone’s thinking, they point it out.  They think they’ve been helpful.  But  rough-draft ideas need to be clarified, researched, and modified before being  subjected to critical evaluation.  The timing of critical evaluation can make the  difference between the life and death of a new idea.  EXAMPLE  A small but growing law firm was looking for office space.  The firm’s administrator  researched the possibilities, then offered a proposal:  “I found 8,000 square feet on the  north side of town for $10,000 per month for a one-year lease.  The owner will lower  the rent to $8,000 if we sign a five-year lease.  We could offset our rent by subletting to  the current tenant.  The north side isn’t great at night, but it’s near public  transportation and has plenty of parking.  I think we should seriously consider this  location.”  This was a fully developed proposal, ready to be critiqued.  If it contained  any flaws, now was the time to find them.   However, several months earlier, the group had shot down the administrator’s initial  proposal.  “Since larger spaces are cheaper,” the administrator had said, “what if we  rented a big office and sublet some of it?”  Someone responded, “Forget it.  We don’t  have time or energy to find people to sublet.”  Someone else said, “I don’t want to be  responsible for too much space.  After all, every landlord in town will make us sign a  five-year lease.  We could really get stuck.”  Note that these quick reactions were based on erroneous assumptions.  It did not require  much effort to find a sublet, and the firm did not have to sign a five-year lease.   Nonetheless, some participants were so quick to criticize the administrator’s thinking  that they killed the idea before the group had a chance to develop it.  After the first  discussion, the administrator stopped looking for places that required sublets.  But six  months later, after looking and looking for a smaller office at a good rent, he  remembered his original idea and pursued it. Premature criticism is often inaccurate.  And stifling.  When ideas are criticized  before they are fully formed, many people feel discouraged and stop trying.   Furthermore, they may become unwilling to volunteer their rough-draft  thinking at future meetings.  They anticipate objections and keep quiet unless  they can invent a counterargument.  Thus, people learn to practice self- censorship.  A group is then deprived of access to its most valuable natural  resource:  the creative thinking of its members.    Community At Work  © 2007     119     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  SUSPENDED JUDGMENT COMMON QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS * Source:  E. de Bono, Lateral Thinking (New York:  Harper & Row, 1970), p. 151. How can I suspend my judgment if I truly do not agree with what  someone else is saying? Suspended judgment does not imply agreement; it implies tolerance.   You don’t have to let go of anything.  You’re just making room for  other people to express their ideas. 11.. What if I know that an idea won’t work? Suspended judgment encourages people to use their creative  imagination.  This often produces impossible ideas.  For example,  “If we were all 20 feet tall, we could save lots of gasoline by walking  more.”  Ideas like these can be the starting point for a new line of  thought.  You don’t have to believe an idea is true; just let yourself  try it on and see what your imagination produces.  After all, “if  humans could fly” was a crazy idea until the twentieth century. 22.. Isn’t collecting silly ideas a waste of time?  Wouldn’t it be more  efficient for us to focus on the realistic options? Suspended judgment comes into play precisely when the so-called  “realistic” options have all been found lacking.  In other words,  creative thinking is the most efficient use of a group’s time when  nothing else works!  Besides, what seems silly to one person may seem  innovative to another.   33.. Doesn’t suspended judgment produce chaotic discussions that go off  in a dozen directions? Only if the process is handled poorly.  To use suspended judgment  effectively, the group should establish clear ground rules and a clear  time limit.  To paraphrase de Bono, informality in the content of a  group’s thinking requires formality in the structure of a group’s  approach to its thinking.* 44.. If I suspend judgment of an idea I think is wrong, how will I get a  chance to critique that idea? Suspended judgment is temporary, not permanent.  Most processes that  call for suspended judgment are designed to last no more than thirty  minutes.  Suspended does not mean abandoned. 55..

GROUND RULES FOR BRAINSTORMING* • • – COMMUNITY AT WORK – When introducing the technique of formal brainstorming to a group, spend  a little time discussing the value of suspended judgment.  Then ask each  participant if s/he is willing to follow these ground rules.  If one or more  members are not, encourage the group to modify the ground rules to fit the  needs of all members.    Community At Work  © 2007     121     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  FACILITATOR TIPS FOR BRAINSTORMING Do start a new flipchart page  before the previous one is full. Do treat silly ideas the same  as serious ideas. Do move around to hold  people’s attention and boost  the group’s energy. Don’t interrupt. Don’t say, “We’ve already got  that one.” Don’t say, “Ooh, good one!” Don’t say, “Hey, you don’t  really want me to write that  one, do you?” Don’t favor the “best” thinkers. Don’t use frowns, raised eyebrows,  or other nonverbal gestures that  signal disapproval. Don’t give up the first time the  group seems stuck. Don’t simultaneously be the leader,  the facilitator, and the chartwriter. Don’t start the process without  clearly setting the time limit. Don’t rush or pressure the group.   Silence usually means that people  are thinking. Do expect a second wind of  creative ideas after the obvious  ones are exhausted. Do repeat the purpose often:   “Who else can explain why our  office systems are so inefficient?” Do encourage full participation:   “Let’s hear from someone who  hasn’t spoken for a while.” DON’T DO Do a lot of mirroring to keep the pace brisk and lively. Do give a warning that the end is  approaching. Do remind people to suspend  judgment.  No critiquing allowed.

Many people respond to this dilemma by  glomming onto one idea and pushing the group to focus on it.  This knee- jerk reaction almost always plunges a group into the Groan Zone, because  different people usually want to focus on different items.  Several better  options are indicated above.  Techniques for culling, sorting, and  categorizing are discussed in detail on the following pages.    Community At Work  © 2007     125     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  When a group has finished a brainstorming process, they often want to  categorize the resulting list of items.  This is natural.  Most people cannot  hold long lists in their head; they get overwhelmed.  The group has to find  some way of reducing the list to a manageable number of items.  Many  people think categorizing is the simplest way to organize the data. But  categorizing involves two separate mental tasks – creating categories and  sorting items into categories – and groups easily confuse these two tasks.  Creating categories is a relatively challenging task for a group, because people  don’t easily reach agreement on the meaning or the importance of a given  category.  Therefore, this task takes time.  Sorting, on the other hand, is  comparatively straightforward once the categories are well defined.  The  problem is that most groups want to do the task of creating categories, but  they want it to feel as simple and easy as the task of sorting items into  categories.  This problem is illustrated by the following case study.   A group of front-line  supervisors brainstormed a list  of “Ways to Get More  Training.”  They decided to  categorize the list.  First they  created four categories:   Workshops, Apprenticeships,  Readings, and Finding Mentors.   Then they began to sort each  item into the four categories. Soon someone suggested that  some of the items might better  fit into a new category, Going  Back to School.  This elicited a  debate on whether Going Back  to School was the same as  Workshops.  The discussion  ended with an agreement to  add the new category.  Then  the group immediately got  caught in a disagreement over  where to place the item “take  classes on computer skills.”   Should it be placed in  Workshops or in Going Back to  School? After a brief squabble,  the members decided to put it  in both places.  But people  were starting to get that feeling  of, “Hey I don’t care, let’s just  get on with it.” Then someone pointed out  that many of their ideas for  apprenticeships involved  mentors. “Don’t all  apprenticeships,” he asked,  “require mentoring?  I don’t  know if mentoring should even  be a separate category.”  Several  participants now got involved  in a spirited discussion about  the role of a mentor.  They  found this issue to be  interesting on its own merits.   Unfortunately, not everyone  felt this way.  A few members  got very antsy.  One person,  irritation in her voice, asked,  “What difference does it make?   Come on, please.” This led someone to say, “Let’s  get focused.  What’s our  purpose here?  What are we  trying to accomplish by doing  this categorizing?”  And sure  enough, the next three  speakers had three different  answers to that question.   At this point, forty minutes  into what was expected to be a  quick-and-easy sorting task,  someone said, “Hey folks, we’re  making this way too hard. Let’s  just do it and get it over with.”   And many heads nodded,  desperately.  From that point  on, everyone agreed to  anything; the experience had  gone sour, and people wanted  just to be done with it.   Five  minutes later it was over. And the finished product?  It  was typed up and promptly  forgotten.  CASE STUDY  CATEGORIZING IN THE REAL WORLD INTRODUCTION    Community At Work  © 2007    126   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    CATEGORIZING IN THE REAL WORLD Why is categorizing harder than people expect it to be?  First of all, many  people tend to assume that crucial terms mean the same thing to everyone.   (“Why are we wasting time over the meaning of workshops?  Let’s just use  common sense.”)  But, in fact, people don’t share common meanings for the  terms they’re using, and this causes group members to feel pulled in two  opposing directions.  (Should we slow down and make an effort to define  our terms?  Or would that just be a waste of precious time?)  This tension  between the desire to clarify meaning and the desire to complete the task  creates an uncomfortable undercurrent of ambiguity. In addition, individuals vary greatly in the number of categories they use to  organize their perceptions.  Some people are detail-oriented.  Their minds  make a lot of distinctions between things, and as a result they tend to  subdivide a list into many categories.  Others are global thinkers; they make  fewer distinctions because their minds operate at a more general, more  abstract level of analysis.  Accordingly, they tend to subdivide a list into  fewer categories.  Neither approach is right or wrong.  But when people with  differing cognitive styles try to create categories together, they are destined  to disagree on such issues as whether workshops is a separate category from go  back to school.  And since disagreements like these are derived from  individual cognitive styles, logical reasoning cannot help to resolve them. INSIGHTS THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM In the case study, it would have been much easier for the group if they had  used predefined criteria to sort their list.  For example, cost is a predefined  criterion, as is desirability. If the group had employed categories like those,  the sorting would have proceeded smoothly and produced useful results.   After identifying some inexpensive training opportunities and some  expensive ones, the group would have been able to discuss next steps.  Sorting the list into categories using predefined categories can usually be  done quite adequately by two or three people.  When this is done, they  show their work to everyone else for revision.  While the small group sorts  the list, the large group can take a break.  Or the large group could divide  into teams that sort the same list into additional categories, using other  predefined criteria.  For example, one team could sort the list by desirability  while another team sorted by importance. USING PREDEFINED CRITERIA TO SORT A LIST    Community At Work  © 2007     127     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  CATEGORIZING IN THE REAL WORLD Creating categories as a group means having a philosophical discussion.  This is  both the value and the cost of creating categories from scratch.  A  philosophical discussion puts a group into the Groan Zone, where they will  have to struggle to integrate one another’s beliefs and definitions.  The  process is uncomfortable and frustrating, and people will resist it.   Sometimes the result is worth the struggle; often it is not.   When people present and define their own categories, they are essentially  presenting their own worldview.  Sometimes this is worth doing, such as  when group members have not yet discussed their values or goals.  Consider,  for example, a community planning group made up of teachers, parents, and  elected officials.  The members of this type of group have diverse frames of  reference. It may be well worth their time to use a discussion of categories as  a way to develop mutual understanding.  A similar example in a business  setting would be a product-development group consisting of members from  marketing, manufacturing, and research and development.  In cases like  these, the opportunity to define categories can prove very useful. OPTIONS CREATING CATEGORIES FROM SCRATCH SUMMARY Creating categories is a difficult task.  It takes a lot of time and can produce a  lot of frustration.  It should be done when people want to gain a deeper  understanding of one another’s values and goals.  Sorting items into predefined  categories is a fairly simple task.  It should be done whenever the primary  reason for categorizing a list is to reduce the list to a mentally manageable  number of items.  A list of thirty or forty items can be sorted in roughly 10  minutes by two or three people.  The results can then be reviewed by the  whole group and revised as needed. Because the opportunity to categorize a list arises so frequently in meetings,   facilitators must understand the differences between creating categories and  sorting.  Those who do can make a real contribution to the development of a  group’s thinking skills.    Community At Work  © 2007    128   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    TWO METHODS OF CATEGORIZING 1.  Each person in turn proposes his  or her own set of categories.   It is acceptable to propose one  category or many on each turn. 2.  Everyone takes as many turns as  they want.  Combinations and  variations are encouraged. 3.  After all sets of categories have  been listed, discuss them. 4.  Sometimes the group’s thinking  converges easily into one set of  categories.  If so, the task is done.   If not, be prepared for a lengthy  discussion. CREATING CATEGORIES BASED ON PREDEFINED CRITERIA 1.  As a group, select one or more  predefined criteria to use as categories     (e.g., “How urgent is each item: high,  medium or low?”  See page 129.) 2.  Recruit two or three people to sort   the list into the selected categories. 3.  The sorters review the list item by  item, making sure to place every item  in a category. 4.  Clarify that it is perfectly fine to place  one item in more than one category,  especially if there is disagreement  about which category is “right.” 5.  When the list is sorted, reconvene the  large group, and revise as needed.

Some situations may call for a category that is not listed  on this page.  For example, at times it might be useful to sort a list by  “likelihood of provoking intense emotions.”  Everyone should feel free to  create a category to fit the circumstances.      Community At Work  © 2007    130   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    CATEGORIZING WITH STICKY NOTES   Participants write their ideas on  stickies, then post them on a wall.   Once all ideas have been posted,  participants approach the wall and  begin to move the stickies around,  grouping related ideas into themes.      The entire process is done silently.     Anyone may relocate a sticky from  one cluster to another.  Thus, ideas  move back and forth until everyone  accepts the categorization. The titles  of the themes emerge from the  group as well.      In this way, participants develop a  common understanding of the  themes as they are built. 1.  Hand out large sticky notes, and have   people write their ideas, one per sticky. 3.  Ask everyone to post their stickies on  the front wall. 4.  Next, have participants physically  cluster the stickies into common  themes.  No talking is permitted. 5.  Each time a new cluster is created, a  participant should title that cluster  with a different colored sticky note. 6.  Over the next several minutes, expect  the clusters to change as new  participants rethink the groupings. 7.  The process ends when everyone sits,  indicating acceptance of the categories. DESCRIPTION INSTRUCTIONS   Community At Work  © 2007     131     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  1.  Each member gets three, four or  five straw votes to distribute  however s/he wants. 2.  It is permissible to cast all votes  for a single item.   3.  Half-votes are permitted, but  not encouraged. 4. The top few items become the  group’s high-priority list. DIVIDE THE LIST BY THREE 1.  Each person casts one vote for every  item s/he wants the group to treat  as a high priority. 2.  Only one vote per item per person. 3.  All items that receive unanimous or  nearly unanimous support become  the group’s high-priority list.   (Note:  Most groups accept “near  unanimity” – i.e, unanimity minus  one or minus two.) Advantages: • Reflects what people actually feel. • Identifies unanimous preferences.  ALL YOU GENUINELY LIKE 1.  Divide the number of items on  the brainstormed list by three. 2.

People get out of their  chair and move around.   This is energizing. With short lists, this  method is often  overkill. SECRET  BALLOT All items on the list are  numbered.  Participants  indicate their preference  by writing their chosen  numbers privately on  paper.  Results are  tabulated by two or  more people. Useful in highly  controversial situations,  especially when someone   might make a different  choice if his or her vote  were going to be made  public. Reinforces the  perception that it is  not safe for people to  reveal their  preferences openly. PERSON BY PERSON Each person takes a  turn to state his or her  preferences.  Often a  go-around is the  simplest way to get  this done. Builds shared understanding  of everyone’s reasoning. Those who go last  have an unfair  advantage: they can  revise their preferences  based on what others  have said.

Reconvene the large group and invite people to share their reflections. Many groups have not developed respectful, supportive group norms.   Their members do not talk to each other in the responsive, encouraging  style shown on the preceding page, The Supportive Attitude in Action.  Instead these groups develop norms that stifle spontaneity and  discourage first-draft thinking.  Members make statements like those  found on the page 136, Injunctions Against Thinking in Public. Such groups have very little capacity to overcome difficult dynamics.   Instead they become trapped in recurring patterns of frustration, conflict,  and withdrawal.  To overcome their patterns, it is essential for these  groups to change their norms and develop cultures that are more  supportive.   This exercise is a strong first step in that direction.  WHY   HOW    Community At Work  © 2007     139     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  Each member of a group has his or her own style of communicating.  Some  people talk in long, detailed paragraphs, while others say one sentence and  quickly withdraw.  In a simple discussion – for example, during Q&A  sessions – people can generally tolerate diverse communication styles  without too much difficulty. However, when a group has to wrestle with a tough problem, people have a  harder time communicating.  Periods of misunderstanding and confusion  are common, leading to feelings of impatience and frustration.   Staying focused at such times is an enormous challenge.  Clear-headed  thinking deteriorates as emotional urgency intensifies.  Some people get so  exasperated and overwhelmed they can barely pay attention.  Others feel  compelled to take over the leadership of the discussion, whether or not they  know how to do it effectively.  Some people just want to withdraw and get  away.  And others, feeling their anger rise, struggle privately to stay cool   when what they really want to do is pick a fight. Despite the rise in tension, many people continue making efforts to stay  present and committed to the task.  They keep trying – but they’re trying  under pressure.  This can’t help but affect their moods, their communication  styles, and their thinking abilities.  Their behavior toward others may be less  than sensitive.  They might blurt out their ideas with less tact than usual.   They might go on and on – oblivious to the effect they’re having on their  audience – because they feel they’re on the verge of an important line of  thought.  These are a few of the countless examples of the symptoms people  exhibit when trying to contribute their best thinking under stress.   The expression of these symptoms makes many people uncomfortable.   If there is a facilitator, people usually look to the facilitator to “save them”  from their anguish.  For example, many people expect a facilitator to  interrupt those who talk to long and silence them.  Alternatively, some  facilitators think it is appropriate to talk to “the difficult person” during a  break to request that s/he tone it down.  So-called solutions like these are  based on a faulty line of analysis – namely, that eliminating a symptom will  somehow remove the cause of the distress. This chapter offers the reader a different perspective.  Difficult dynamics are  treated as group situations that can be handled supportively rather than as   individual personalities that need to be fixed.

Read the handout titled “Communication Styles That Bug People.”   Identify any styles that might irritate you.  (It’s okay to include styles  that are not listed on the handout.) 2.  Form small groups.  With your partners, discuss your personal reactions  to the communication styles that annoy you. 3.  In the space provided below, write down anything about your own  communication style that might bother someone else. 4.  At your discretion, share your reflections with your partners. 5.

Describe the predicament.  Use facts to support your observations:  “The  group is having trouble staying on topic.  Three people have asked us to  stay focused on the budget, but someone keeps changing the subject.” 2. Obtain agreement to proceed:  “It might be useful to step back from the  discussion for a moment and explore what’s getting in the way.  I have a  simple way to do this and would like your agreement to proceed.” 3. When agreement is obtained, ask a question that focuses on the process,  not the content, of the preceding discussion. For example, “Does anyone  have any thoughts about the way we are working together?”     4. After three or four responses, ask a more pointed question.  For example,  “What might be blocking us from working more effectively?” 5. When participants seem ready to return to the original task, prepare the  group to make the shift.  Ask, “Before we return to [the topic], are there  any further reactions to what has just been said?”     6. Option:  Call a short break at this point.  The group’s leadership will  probably use the time to rethink the agenda. THE TECHNIQUE THE SITUATION Meetings sometimes get bogged down for unclear reasons.  For example,  during a discussion some people keep bringing up a topic about which the  group had already made a decision.  At such times, a facilitator may be  tempted to ask the group, “What’s going on here?  We appear to be stuck.   Does anyone have any ideas why?”   One might expect such a comment to help a group reflect on their process.   But it seldom works.  The sudden “level shift” is too confusing.  A few  people will respond to the facilitator, but most will keep discussing the  original topic.  The problem is that some people don’t realize they are being  asked to step back from the discussion and talk about their process.   Here’s a better strategy.  First, point out that something isn’t working.  Next,  obtain the group’s agreement to step back from the discussion and talk  about their process.  This is the crucial step.  Once members signal their  readiness to proceed, everyone together can explore what’s blocking them. STEPPING OUT OF THE CONTENT AND TALKING ABOUT THE PROCESS    Community At Work  © 2007    144   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    Current events sometimes interfere with a group’s ability to concentrate.   After a terrible storm, for example, people need to talk about their flooded  basements and leaking roofs.  After an election, people need to discover how  they feel about the potential impacts.  During an organizational transition –  a massive layoff, say – people need to let off steam and express their  anxieties. What should a group do when faced with distractions like these?  Many  people believe that the best response is to ignore their existence.  This belief  is grounded in value judgments, however, not empirical fact.  Realistically,  the presence of a serious distraction will lower a group’s efficiency regardless  of what group members are officially allowed to talk about. This activity gives people the chance to spend a well-structured period of  time talking about what’s really on their minds.  After expressing  themselves, they are often better able to concentrate on the work at hand. 1.  If it’s obvious that the group is having trouble focusing on the topic at  hand, suggest that people talk about whatever might be the source of  distraction.  For example, “I notice we’re having a hard time  concentrating on this subject, and I’m aware that [the recent event] is on  a lot of people’s minds.  Could we step back and spend a few minutes  talking about [the event]?” 2.  After securing agreement from the group to proceed, pose an open-ended  question, such as, “What are people feeling about [the event]?”  Ask  everyone to respond. 3.  When everyone has spoken, suggest a sequence for making the transition  back to the main topic.  For example, “What if we spend a few more  minutes in this conversation, then take a short break and return to the  main topic after the break?” THE SITUATION HANDLING OUT-OF-CONTEXT DISTRACTIONS THE TECHNIQUE 145 Community At Work © 2007 FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING Set the frame.   Unveil a flipchart titled “GROUP DYNAMICS.”  The  chart is blank except for the words “Discussion Begins” near the left  margin and “Decision Is Made” near the right margin.  Explain that  you want to present a model which may help to explain why  meetings can sometimes be so confusing and frustrating. Introduce the concepts of divergent thinking and convergent thinking.  On  the left third of the flipchart, draw four or five arrows that signify  divergent thinking.  Describe what the arrows represent, and give  some examples (e.g., listing causes, generating options, expressing  different opinions).  On the right third of the chart, (leaving the  mid-section blank), draw arrows that signify convergent thinking.   Give some examples (e.g., prioritizing, combining, evaluating).   Introduce the Groan Zone.  Indicate that sometimes a group is neither  diverging nor converging, but seems instead to be doing both at the  same time.  Embellish with examples and anecdotes.  Explain the  core problem:  mutual misunderstanding.  Assert that even though  the Groan Zone can be an enormously confusing and frustrating  phase, it is a normal, necessary phase in which people struggle to  understand and be understood. Discuss implications.  Label the two zones, and explain that this is a  well-known model.  Now ask for comments.  A key point:  A group of  people can and should engage in very different behavior patterns at  different points in a meeting – e.g., sometimes people can be creative,  nonjudgmental, and free-thinking, while at other times the very same  people can be focused, evaluative, and succinct.  Encourage reality-testing.  Ask people to share war stories and test the  model against their actual experience.  If feasible, use small groups for  this step.  Discuss implications.  Ask for questions and comments.  In the ensuing  discussion, make an effort to clarify the principle that if the group’s  eventual goal is to seek a sustainable agreement (i.e., a win/win  decision based on an inclusive solution), then the resolution of the  Groan Zone will occur when a framework of shared understanding has  been built.   TEACHING A GROUP ABOUT GROUP DYNAMICS     Community At Work  © 2007    146   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    1. Introduce the Check-In as a time for everyone to briefly report on the  mood s/he is bringing to the meeting.  Indicate that it is also appropriate  for people to mention non-work-related issues that might be on their  minds.  If anyone questions the purpose of this activity, you can explain  that this is a time to make the transition from “outside the meeting” to  “inside the meeting.”  For many people, the act of sharing a little bit of  personal information helps them make this transition.  2. Ask for a volunteer to go first.  As with all go-arounds, ask this person to  say, “I’m done” or “pass” when s/he is finished checking in. 3. If someone interrupts another group member’s check-in, stop that  person.  Say, “This is not a time for comments from others.  The person  who is checking in is the only one who can talk.” 4. When everyone has checked in, make a global statement that  acknowledges what people have just said.  For example, “Sounds like a lot  of people are feeling overextended this week.”  Then move into the  business section of the agenda. A Check-In is a go-around that happens at the beginning of a meeting.   People use it to share their mood and to briefly mention anything that  might affect their participation.  Each person takes a turn saying, in effect,  “Here’s how it feels to be me today.” Everyone faces non-work-related problems now and then.  They range in  degree from mild  (“I’m having a bad hair day”) to severe (“My mother is  dying”).  A Check-In allows people to tell each other what they’re facing, in  a way that informs without being obtrusive. The Check-In is one of the most powerful methods for helping group  members strengthen their relationships.  Recognizing that they will devote  most of their discussion-time to work-related issues, a Check-In provides  members with a gentle format for getting to know one another in greater  depth as multi-dimensional human beings. PURPOSE PROCEDURE THE CHECK-IN A PERSONAL WAY TO BEGIN MEETINGS    Community At Work  © 2007     147     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  REASONS  FOR DOING A  CHECK-IN A Check-In builds group  cohesion by causing  everyone to participate in a  common activity right from the  first moments of a meeting. It provides a transition from   “outside the meeting,” to “inside  the meeting.”  It helps members  shift the focus of their attention  by expressing something in  order to let go of it. Everyone occasionally has to  deal with a severe “outside  problem,” like the death or illness  of a loved one.  A Check-In lets  people inform the group, without  making a big issue of it. A regular Check-In is a solid  investment in the long-term  development of mutual trust. People use it to let each  other know that they may  have feelings lingering from  the previous meeting. It helps the group to be  patient with someone who  is having a “bad hair day.” A Check-In is a “go-around” that happens at the beginning of a meeting.   People use it to share their mood and to briefly mention anything that might  affect their participation.  Each person takes a turn saying, in essence, “Here's  how it feels to be me today.”    Community At Work  © 2007    148   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    The most straightforward way to overcome a group’s tendency to defer to the  person-in-charge is to identify the tendency and educate the group.  Acknowledge  that it takes courage to speak truthfully in a hierarchy.  Ask people to discuss  what they might say differently if the person-in-charge were not in the room.   Some people will respond defensively; others will be surprisingly honest.   Remember that everyone – from the boldest risk taker to the most cautious  diplomat – will need the facilitator’s respect and support. Have the person-in-charge  speak first. Set aside time to  criticize the ideas of the person-in-charge. Use “unanimity” as the decision rule for making agreements. Have the person-in-charge leave the room for part of the discussion. Overcoming a Group’s Natural Tendency to Defer to the Person-in-Charge Have people write their  individual thoughts on a topic  first, then share them aloud. Submit  comments  anonymously. Break into small  groups for part of  the discussion. Give this page to the  person-in-charge. Use a Go-around  and have the person-in-charge speak last. Chartwrite the  group’s discussion  frequently.

DOMINATION BY A HIGHLY  VERBAL MEMBER Inexperienced facilitators  often try to control this  person.  “Excuse me, Mr. Q,  do you mind if I let  someone else take a turn?” Or, even worse, “Excuse me,  Ms. Q, but you’re taking up  a lot of the group’s time . . .” When one or two people are over-participating, everyone  else is under-participating.   So, focus your efforts on the  passive majority.  Encourage  them to participate more.   Trying to change the  dominant participants just  sends even more attention  their way. GOOFING AROUND  IN THE MIDST OF A  DISCUSSION Try to “organize” people by  getting into a power struggle  with them.  Raise your voice  if necessary.  Single out the   individuals who seem to be  the ringleaders. “All right everyone, let’s get  back to work.”  (Or better  yet, “Focus, people, focus!”) Often a break is the best  response.  People become  undisciplined when they are  overloaded or worn out.   After a breather, they will be  much better able to focus. Alternatively, ask for advice:   “Is there something we ought  to be doing differently?” LOW  PARTICIPATION  BY THE ENTIRE  GROUP Assume that silence means  consent.  Don’t ask whether  everyone understands the key  issues and agrees with what’s  being said.  (That just wastes  time unnecessarily.) Praise the group for all the  work that’s getting done, in  the hope that flattery will  motivate more people to  participate. Always be suspicious of low  participation.  Dependency,  anger, or fear are often  factors in play.  The group,  however, may not want to  surface those feelings.  If not,  shift from open discussion to a  format that lowers the  anxiety level.  Work in small  groups, or build a list, or try  a highly structured activity  like a fishbowl or a jigsaw.

SEVERAL  DIFFERENT TOPICS  BEING DISCUSSED  AT THE SAME TIME “Come on, everyone, let’s  get back on track.”   “Focus, people, focus!!” Select the topic you think  the group would most  benefit from discussing, and  do your best to sell your  point of view:  “I’m not at  all attached to this, but . . .” Use tracking:  Name the  various topics in play.  “Let  me see if I can summarize the  key themes being discussed.” Use linking: “Can you help us  link your idea to the central  issues before us?” Create a parking lot for ideas  and issues to return to later. MANY PEOPLE   INTERRUPTING  ONE ANOTHER,  IN COMPETITION  FOR AIRTIME Take control.  Don’t be shy  about interrupting the  conversation yourself, in  order to exhort people to be  more respectful. Select one person to speak,  but give no indication of  whose turn will come next.   That would undercut  spontaneity. If you must interrupt in  order to restore decorum,  say, “Pat, I’m going to cut in  here.  First, let’s make sure  your point is being heard.  Then, I want to suggest a  process that will cut down  on further interruptions.”   After you complete your  paraphrase, use stacking,  tracking, and sequencing to  organize the group. PEOPLE TREAT  ONE ANOTHER  DISRESPECTFULLY Ignore it altogether.            No sense throwing fuel on  the fire. Pretend that posting a  ground rule imploring  people to “be respectful”  will somehow create  respectful behavior. Increase the frequency of  your paraphrasing.  People  under pressure need support. If proposing a ground rule,  be sure to create time for the  group to reflect on what’s  happening and what they  want to do differently.

MINIMAL  PARTICIPATION  BY MEMBERS  WHO DON’T  FEEL INVESTED  IN THE TOPIC Act as though silence  signifies agreement with  what’s been said. Ignore them and be thankful  they’re not making trouble. Encourage a discussion:  “What’s important to me about  this topic?”  Warm up in pairs,  so everyone has time to explore  his or her stake in the outcome. Before next meeting, ask the  planners to assess why people  don’t seem more invested. POOR  FOLLOW-THROUGH  ON ASSIGNMENTS Give an ineffective pep talk. Ignore it.   Excuse it:  “Oh well, we  didn’t really need that  information anyway.” Assign the work to teams.  Build in a report-back process  at a midpoint before the  assignment is due.  This gives  anyone having trouble  a  chance to get help. FAILURE TO  START ON TIME  AND END ON TIME Announce, “We’re going to  start in five minutes.”  Then,   five minutes later, repeat the  same announcement, but  this time say, “Just a few  more minutes.” Wait for the arrival of the  “people who count,” but  don’t bother waiting for  anyone with lower ranking. When it’s time to end, go  overtime without asking. If anyone has to leave, they  should know how to tiptoe  out without disturbing  anyone. Option 1:  Start the meeting   when it is scheduled to begin.  (Principle:  Keep your word.)  Option 2:  Wait for everyone to  arrive.  (Principle:  If someone’s  attendance isn’t valuable, why is  s/he coming in the first place?)  Waiting for all will demonstrate  that one person’s tardiness can  waste a lot of salaried staff time. Note:  Make sure it is the  person-in-charge, not you, who  sets the policy and enforces it.   If meetings chronically run late,  improve your agenda planning.

TWO PEOPLE LOCKING HORNS Put the focus exclusively on  the interaction between the  two disputing parties, as  though no one else in the  room has an opinion on the  issue at hand. Or, treat the two like  children.  “Come on, you  two, can’t you get along?”  Reach out to others: “Who  else has an opinion on this  issue?” or “Are there any  other issues that need to be  discussed before we go too  much further with this one?” Remember:  When the  majority is passive, focus your  attention on them, not on the  over-active few. ONE OR TWO  SILENT MEMBERS  IN A GROUP  WHOSE OTHER  MEMBERS   PARTICIPATE  ACTIVELY “Mr. Z, you haven’t talked  much today.  Is there  anything you’d like to add?”  This may work when a shy  member has nonverbally  indicated a wish to speak.   But all too often, the quiet  person feels put on the spot  and withdraws further. “I’d like to get opinions from  those who haven’t talked for  a while.” Breaking into small groups  works even better, allowing   shy members to speak up  without being pressed to  compete for airtime. SIDE CONVERSATIONS  AND WHISPERED  CHUCKLES Ignore the behavior and  hope it will go away. Chastise the whisperers, in  the belief that humiliation is  an excellent corrective. With warmth and humor,   make an appeal for decorum:    “As you know, those who don’t  hear the joke often wonder if   someone is laughing at them.”   If the problem persists, assume  there’s a reason.  Has the topic  become boring and stale?  Do  people need a break?

Ask participants to look back on the  previous meeting and recall anything  that made them feel uncomfortable. 2.  Brainstorm a list:  What can we do to  handle this better in the future? 3.  If everyone agrees to abide by one or  more items on the list, fine.  Often,  however, agreement does not come  easily because unresolved feelings  may still be present.  Rather than  attempt to force an agreement  prematurely, treat Steps 1 and 2 as a  consciousness-raising activity.  Often,  simply naming a problem goes a long  way toward changing it.

Keep the meeting interesting by making sure the people who give  reports use overheads and pie charts.   5.  If you’ve got an agenda of difficult and important items, improve  efficiency by skipping breaks and shortening lunch.   6.  When the most important discussion is likely to be emotionally  charged, save it for last.  Maybe the group will be more ready to  deal with it by then.   7.  Since everyone prefers their meetings to stay on track, assume that  no one will raise a topic that’s not on the agenda.   8.  When you know the agenda is too packed, assume the meeting  will run overtime.  But don’t tell anyone in advance.  People  sometimes do their best thinking under pressure.   9.  To maintain your flexibility, don’t put the agenda in writing.   10.  Don’t waste time planning an agenda.

These three components can be thought of as  the building blocks of meeting planning.   Each topic to be discussed can be viewed as a segment of the meeting.  For  example, if the group were going to discuss three topics – a marketing issue,  a staffing issue, and a budget issue – each topic would be discussed separately  and should thus be treated as a distinct segment.   The desired outcome of each topic can be viewed as the goal for that segment  of the meeting.  For example, the desired outcome of discussing the  marketing issue might be a plan for developing a new website.   The process refers to the activity (or set of activities) the group will do to  achieve the desired outcome.  Such activities include brainstorming,  categorizing, debating, and many more. TOPICS TOPICS OUTCOMES OUTCOMES PROCESSES PROCESSES THREE COMPONENTS OF A MEETING    Community At Work  © 2007    158   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    The agenda is like a game plan.  It describes how the work of the meeting  will be done.   Creating an agenda involves identifying the topics to be discussed, defining  the desired outcomes for each topic, and designing the processes to achieve  the desired outcomes.  Planning out the work of the meeting therefore  means answering three questions, in the following sequence: 1. What topics do we want to address? 2. What outcome do we want for each topic? 3. What activity (or set of activities) will best support the group to  achieve each desired outcome? Assigning estimated times for each activity is done in tandem with Step 3. The following pages provide concepts and tools for accomplishing some of  the most challenging aspects of planning meetings effectively.

As shown, the overall goal of a given project may take several meetings to  achieve.  By comparison, each meeting can be seen on its own terms, as a  context within which the group can make progress toward the overall  goal, by achieving two or three narrow meeting goals.  As the following  pages will clarify, meeting goals are specific, well-defined, realistic goals,  designed to be achieved in the time frame of a single meeting. * The graphic is also known as a Milestone Map.

The picture above shows a single meeting, broken into  three segments. In the diagram, the goals for the segments are not yet defined.  The  following paragraphs demonstrate that an overall goal and a meeting goal can  be defined for each topic. Topic 1:  Staffing the project.  An example of a suitable overall goal is, “Hire  sufficent staff to successfully complete our project.”  By contrast, the  meeting goal would be much more limited.  For instance it might be, “Agree  on the criteria for potential staff, and draft a plan for recruiting them.” Topic 2:  The project budget.  A likely overall goal is, “Finalize the budget for  this project.”  A meeting goal might be, “Identify budget items that need  discussion, and assign someone to bring relevant data to the next meeting.” Topic 3: Performance Appraisal.  A sample overall goal is,  “Design a way to  monitor and assess performance on this project.”  A much narrower meeting  goal could be, “Set performance standards for key roles.” END OF MEETING START OF MEETING TWO TYPES OF DESIRED OUTCOMES   Community At Work  © 2007     161     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  Defining the desired outcomes for each topic on the agenda is  the most difficult task in planning a meeting.  At the core of  this difficulty is the necessity to distinguish between the overall  goal for the topic and the meeting goal for that same topic.   • • — COMMUNITY AT WORK — What final result do we want to  achieve in order to be completely  done with this topic? THE OVERALL GOAL FOR THIS TOPIC  What narrowly-defined, specific   objective do we want to achieve for  this topic at an upcoming meeting?

Descriptions of each of the seven  types of meeting goals are presented in the following seven pages.  163 Community At Work © 2007 FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING MEETING GOAL:  SHARE INFORMATION DESCRIPTION   When someone makes an announcement, a report or a  presentation, his or her meeting goal is to share information.   EXAMPLE   Suppose a project team is working on their budget.  Suppose also  that the overall goal for that topic is, “Finalize the budget for this project.”   And further, suppose that the upcoming meeting is being designed by  someone we’ll call the meeting planner.  If the meeting planner’s objective is  to give everyone access to last year’s financial data, then the meeting goal is  to share information. The planner might accomplish this goal by passing out a  document and requesting that everyone read it by next meeting.  Or he  might have someone make a presentation and field questions along the way.   Both of these processes are well within the boundaries of the basic meeting  goal of sharing information. KEY INSIGHT   When the participants at a meeting understand that the goal  is to share information, they tend to restrict their participation to questions  of clarification – accompanied, perhaps, by brief statements of opinion or  suggestions about what to do next.  However, when people do not realize that  the goal is to share information, they participate much more actively and  substantively.  This occurs when people believe they are expected to make  progress on a topic – in other words, when they perceive that the meeting  goal is to advance the thinking on the topic, not just to share information.

EXAMPLE   Let’s continue with the example of a project team working on  their budget.  As before, suppose that the overall goal for that topic is,  “Finalize the budget for this project.”  Now, imagine that the planner’s  objective is to find out how people will react to three different budget  scenarios.  He might create a questionnaire.  Or he might ask people to call  out their thoughts, brainstorm style.  Or he might divide them into breakout  groups.  Thus he can use different participation formats to obtain input, but  he has the same meeting goal, regardless of the process he uses. KEY INSIGHT   When participants understand that the goal is to obtain their  input, not to make decisions as a group, they are less prone to spend time  attempting to influence one another.  Instead, they focus their efforts on  influencing the opinions of the person who is asking for input.  More often  than not, this person is their boss.  When participants don’t realize that the goal is to obtain input, they might  mistakenly believe that they’re being asked to participate in making  decisions.  But that’s a different goal altogether.  The well-known complaint,  “Why ask for my opinion if you don’t want to use it?” reflects this  confusion.  Frustrations of this type can be avoided by planners who make it  clear that the meeting goal is to obtain input. 165 Community At Work © 2007 FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING MEETING GOAL:  ADVANCE THE THINKING DESCRIPTION    When a meeting planner wants the group to make progress  on a topic, his or her goal is to advance the thinking on a specific step or task. EXAMPLE   There are many types ways a group can advance the thinking at a  single meeting.  Here is a representative sample: • Define a problem       • Create a milestone map • Analyze a problem       • Create a work breakdown structure • Identify root causes      • Conduct a resource analysis • Identify underlying patterns   • Conduct a risk assessment • Sort a list of ideas into themes   • Define selection criteria • Rearrange a list of items  by priority • Evaluate options  • Draw a flowchart       • Identify critical success factors • Identify core values      • Edit and/or wordsmith a statement Note that clear deliverables can be defined for every task shown above.  These  are not just activities; they all produce tangible outputs. KEY INSIGHT    Most projects involve several stages of work, and normally,   many steps of thinking are embedded in each stage.  Yet progress usually  entails taking one step at a time.  Thus, advancing the thinking is a legitimate  meeting goal.  This realization helps a planner become more precise in setting  realistic and useful objectives. SEVEN TYPES  OF  MEETING GOALS Obtain Input Improve Communication Build  Community Build Capacity  Make Decisions Share  Information Advance  The Thinking Community At Work © 2007 FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING 166 MEETING GOAL:  MAKE DECISIONS DESCRIPTION   When a planner wants a group to address an issue and bring it  to closure at the next meeting, the meeting goal is to make a decision. EXAMPLE   Decisions that can be made at a meeting range from very simple  to very difficult.  The simple ones are those that are easy to think about –  either because the stakes are low or because the issues are straightforward and     familiar, with predictable consequences.  For example, the majority of  decisions in a budget-planning process turn out to be routine confirmations  of ongoing programs and salaries.  It’s usually not problematic for groups to  make simple decisions together at meetings.   By contrast, difficult decisions are quite challenging for groups to make.  For  example, a budget decision to cut a program or reduce payroll usually  requires much more analysis and consideration.  In other words, difficult   decisions are best made after the issues have been well thought through. KEY INSIGHT    Whether an issue is simple or complex, a commitment to  make decisions at the next meeting means just that:  the group is expected to  bring the issue to closure.  If a planner places a simple decision on the  agenda, s/he can reasonably expect the group to achieve that goal.  However,  if a planner commits the group to make a difficult decision at the meeting,  s/he is assuming that the challenging aspects have been adequately addressed.   If they have not been, it probably makes more sense to commit the group to a  meeting goal of advancing the thinking, not of making decisions.

EXAMPLE   A project team recently missed an important deadline.  Some group  members blamed the database coordinator for not finishing the data entry on  schedule.  Others blamed the project manager for creating a timetable that they  felt was unrealistic to begin with.  No one discussed their feelings openly at project  meetings, but morale declined until the group set aside part of a meeting to raise  these issues and clear the air. KEY INSIGHT   People normally do not consider their feelings to be appropriate  subject matter for a meeting.  Yet when a group schedules time to step away from  task-related issues, so members can instead talk about their feelings and their  relationships with one another, the benefits to a group can be significant.   Unrecognized misperceptions and misunderstandings can be discovered and acted  on. Paralyzing interpersonal grievances can be named, discussed, and reconciled.   Dysfunctional group norms and patterns can be uncovered, explored, and replaced  by more desirable procedures.  But benefits notwithstanding, people normally do  not engage in discussing this type of material unless they are given explicit permission  to do so.  And even then, it usually takes well-planned, well-structured activity to  create the safe, supportive foundation this type of work requires.

EXAMPLE   A project team was working on their budget, with the overall goal of  finalizing it.  After two meetings on this topic, the project manager determined  that key members did not understand basic accounting principles, causing them to  become lost and confused during relevant discussions.  The project manager  decided to invite someone from the accounting department to spend a few hours  with the group, teaching the relevant essentials of accounting. KEY INSIGHT   Capacity-building is rarely viewed as something that can be done at  a normal meeting.  Instead, it is usually seen as training that should be done in  classes offered by the training department, or by external programs and vendors.   When instead it is treated as a meeting goal, many possibilities for increasing  capacity arise.  For example, team members can improve their problem-solving and  decision-making capabilities;  they can increase their knowledge of major trends in  their industry;  they can become more adept at a particular skill or best practice. SEVEN TYPES  OF  MEETING GOALS Obtain Input Improve Communication Build  Community Share  Information Advance  The Thinking Make Decisions Build Capacity 169 Community At Work © 2007 FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING MEETING GOAL:  BUILD COMMUNITY DESCRIPTION   When a meeting planner wants to promote camaraderie, strengthen  the bonds among people who work together, and generally boost morale, the  meeting goal is to build community. EXAMPLE   The project team decided that they would have a little celebration when  they finalized their budget.  They did not consider the achievement to be so major  as to justify a grand celebration, yet neither did they want it to pass without some  formal acknowledgment.  The project manager decided to invite the project sponsor  to come to the last hour of a late-afternoon meeting, at which time the group would  present the budget to the sponsor for his final approval.  By design, the sponsor  would have seen the budget ahead of time.  His main reason for coming to the  meeting was to contribute to the goal of building community, which he did by  offering some words of praise to the group – and by staying around for the food and  drink, which the project manager then produced. KEY INSIGHT   Community building is not normally considered to be a legitimate  meeting goal.   Yet when it is seen as a meeting goal, it can achieve its purpose of  strengthening bonds and boosting morale quite effectively.  Celebrating  birthdays  can happen delightfully in 5-10 minutes.  Likewise, the effect of sharing reactions as  a group to a distressing current event is profound.  Building community is not  dependent on team-building offsites, as long as it is designed onto the agenda just  like every other meeting goal.

This is the first  question a meeting planner has to answer, when s/he designs a process to  achieve a meeting goal.  For example, suppose obtain input on a budget   proposal is the meeting goal.  The planner might want the group simply to  raise questions and make a few comments.  Or  s/he might prefer the group  to engage in extensive discussion over key parts of the proposal.  Obviously  an extensive discussion will pull for more participation.  Which level of  participation does the planner consider to be most desirable, given the goal?   WHAT ACTIVITIES?    Once a planner sets the desired level of involvement,  s/he can focus on designing an activity that encourages participation at the  appropriate level.  For example, if extensive discussion is desired, breakout  groups might be a suitable activity.  But if it is sufficient for the group to  make a few comments, a single go-around might do the trick. HOW MUCH TIME?    A planner can and should estimate the time it will take  to achieve a given meeting goal after the two preceding steps have been  explored.  If it then appears that a given activity will require too much time,  the planner can decide whether to change the activity or change the level of  involvement desired.   DESIGNING A PROCESS  TO ACHIEVE A MEETING GOAL LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT ACTIVITY TIME ESTIMATE LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT ACTIVITY TIME ESTIMATE TOPICS OUTCOMES PROCESSES TOPICS OUTCOMES PROCESSES   Community At Work  © 2007     175     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  Here is a model that delineates five distinct levels of group participation and   involvement.  It can be used as a tool that assists meeting planners to design  a process, once they have determined a meeting goal for a given topic. If a planner does not want a group to spend very much time or energy on a  particular goal, s/he should choose activities that correspond to the lower  levels in this diagram.  On the other hand, if s/he considers it important for  group members to dig deeply into the issues at hand, then s/he would want  to design a process that promotes the higher levels of involvement. The processes that are associated with each of the lower three levels are self- evident.  Presenting and Reporting is a one-way activity, which requires group  members merely to sit and listen – and hopefully, to stay awake.  Comments  and Questions require active participation, but on a limited basis.  Extensive  Discussion requires sustained concentration and effort. The two higher levels of involvement push a group into the Groan Zone.   Convergence and Alignment requires participants to become able to think from  each other’s points of view, and to tolerate the tensions that arise during  periods of misunderstanding, until they build a shared framework of  understanding.  Ownership and Commitment requires all of the above, with  the added requirement that the participants persevere until they produce a  solution that gains enthusiastic endorsement from all key participants. FIVE LEVELS OF INVOLVEMENT 1.  PRESENTING & REPORTING 5.  OWNERSHIP & COMMITMENT 4.  CONVERGENCE & ALIGNMENT 3.  EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION 2.  COMMENTS & QUESTIONS     Community At Work  © 2007    176   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    This diagram is provided as a reminder of the many activities described in  Chapter 7.  When designing an agenda, a meeting planner  can select  participation formats from this page to encourage a suitable level of  involvement from participants.   When a meeting goal calls for presenting and reporting, the process design is  straightforward and self-evident.  When a meeting goal calls for questions  and comments, the planner has more latitude in selecting a suitable activity.   All the simple formats – go-arounds, small groups, open discussion, listing  ideas, and individual writing –  are candidates for facilitating involvement at  the level of questions and comments. When designing activities for meeting goals that pull for higher levels of  involvement, planners can string together three or four different  participation formats, one after the other, to produce the desired outcome.  (See the next page.) Or they can create activities that are more sophisticated  and intricate – such as the 40 activities provided in Chapters 14 -16 of this  book.

For example, if a meeting  goal is to advance the thinking on a job description, a group could list attributes of the  job; then categorize the list into themes; then break into small groups to write up  each theme.  This way of sequencing activities is called a string.

INDIVIDUAL WRITING 5-10  minutes  Allow 5 minutes for writing that is a  “warm-up” to something else.  Allow  10 minutes for writing that has a   substantive purpose. BREAKOUT  GROUPS 30-90 minutes  Decide how much time to allow the  groups to work.  Then add 10  minutes for the shuffle to and from  the breakout rooms.   MAKING TIME ESTIMATES FOR ACTIVITIES PROCESS TIPS FOR ESTIMATING TIME  TYPICAL TIME  SMALL GROUPS  6-15 minutes  Decide how much time to give each  person to speak.

GO-AROUNDS 5-20 minutes for an  8-person group,  depending on topic Assume 30 seconds per person for a  simple question, and 2 minutes per  person when the topic is deemed to be  challenging or especially interesting. LISTING IDEAS 7-10 minutes  The time limit for listing ideas is  entirely arbitrary.  However, more  than 10 minutes without discussion  is difficult for many to tolerate. 15-30 minutes  OPEN  DISCUSSION If high involvement is desired,  assume the discussion will hit its  stride after 5-10 minutes.  When an  open discussion runs longer than  20-30 minutes, attention will flag.   Community At Work  © 2007     179     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING     Every topic to be covered at the meeting is clearly identified. PROPERTIES OF AN EFFECTIVE AGENDA    Both the overall goal and the meeting goal for each topic have been  defined.  These may or may not be written onto the agenda, but they  can and will be explicitly stated as needed.   Realistic time estimates have been made for each activity.  The  estimated times may or may not be posted, but they will be reported  when the process is described.     The agenda ends with a way to provide participants with a sense of  completion:  a summary of accomplishments and a review of next  steps, an evaluation of the meeting, or an opportunity for everyone to  make a closing remark.   A scheduled 10-minute break occurs whenever a meeting runs longer  than 2 hours.      The agenda is written and accessible – either as a printout distributed to  everyone or as a flipchart posted on the wall.    Each meeting goal is supported by a process that has been designed  with the intention of encouraging an appropriate level of  involvement.  The process consists of one or more activities.  In  cases involving a highly substantive meeting goal, when no single  activity will achieve the goal, a series of activities can be combined  into a string.    The agenda begins with two items that bring people into the room: an  overview (so everyone knows roughly what to expect for the rest of the  meeting) and a brief welcoming activity, like a check-in.  (See page 146.)    Community At Work  © 2007    180   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    This diagram shows the underlying structure of an effective agenda.  In  the real world, each group customizes this structure to fit its own  circumstances.  The following pages present templates for six approaches  in common use. AGENDA TEMPLATES • • TODAY’S AGENDA  — COMMUNITY AT WORK — 3. One or more substantive topics. 1. A way to start the meeting. 2. Easy items. 4. A break, if the meeting is planned  to run more than two hours. 6. A way to complete the meeting. 5. Further substantive topics.   Community At Work  © 2007     181     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  BEST USE:   This format is used for ongoing management-team meetings  at which decisions are needed for several major items the same day. TIMING:   Quick Business in this format often takes 30-45 minutes.  The  items can be handled in a line-’em-up, knock-’em-down fashion.  Each  Major Topic will run at least 30 minutes – usually longer.  Overall, a  meeting with more than one major topic should be designed to last at  least 2.5 hours.  Major topics require more attention to process design  than quick business items.  Most quick business items can be handled by  a simple open discussion.  — COMMUNITY AT WORK — — Break — 3.

Examples include developing a strategic plan, setting an  annual budget, planning a sizable layoff, or designing a reorganization.  This  type of meeting requires planners to design a well-thought-out process. TIMING:   These meetings typically last 3-6 hours per session.  The project  often runs for several weeks or more.  Quick business is best done by giving  each person 5-7 minutes to use as s/he wishes.  Unfinished items are  recorded on a back burner, to be dealt with off line or at the next meeting. — COMMUNITY AT WORK — 3.

Community At Work  © 2007     183     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  BEST USE:   This format – a simplified Robert’s Rules –  is used in  volunteer organizations, especially in board meetings.  Since members are  not regular co-workers, they tend not to spend much time thinking about  the agenda items between meetings.  Therefore, minutes from prior  meetings are used as the key tool to structure the agenda.   TIMING:   The meeting lasts as long as it takes to complete old business  and new business.  Under time pressure, groups tend to defer many items. — COMMUNITY AT WORK — 3. Old Business • Begin with oldest outstanding item    recorded in the minutes, which lists    items tabled from prior meetings. • Deal with the item or table it again. • Continue until every old business     item is either handled or tabled. 1. Adoption of Last Meeting’s Minutes  5. Meeting Evaluation OLD BUSINESS /  NEW BUSINESS • • 2. Announcements and Reports 4.

Meeting Evaluation LINE ’EM UP & KNOCK ’EM DOWN • • BEST USE:   This format is used at an ongoing staff meeting, at which  most business items are straightforward.  This format requires no advance  planning, and therefore the desired outcome must be clarified in real time  during the meeting.  When complex topics are raised, they may be  discussed as input, but they are rarely decided at the meeting. TIMING:   Today’s Business Items lasts for a fixed time, usually 45 minutes.   Overall, this type of meeting is usually scheduled to last 1 hour.   Community At Work  © 2007     185     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  BEST USE:   This format is especially suitable for groups whose members  have different areas of responsibility.  It can be used both to obtain input  and to make decisions.  Note, however, that this format will work only if  each member prepares in advance by defining the overall goal and meeting  goal for each topic s/he raises. TIMING:   Each group determines for itself how much time to allot each  member.  Everyone receives equal time unless someone negotiates for more.   — COMMUNITY AT WORK — 3.

Check-in 2. Announcements 4. Meeting Evaluation STATUS REPORTS • • BEST USE:   This format is useful for meetings of project teams. It’s also  useful for program staff meetings at which most staff members are working  independently, and want to keep one another updated.  TIMING:   To keep people engaged, status reports should take no more than  10-15 minutes per report.  Half that time should be spent discussing action  items.  This type of meeting takes less than 1 hour.  To shorten the meeting  further, not everyone has to report at every meeting.

Business as Usual NEW TOPIC ✔ FAMILIAR OPINIONS DECISION POINT The diagram shown above represents an idealized sequence of the  relationship between the discussion that precedes a decision, and the  implementation that follows a decision.  The discussion is quick and direct,  and the implementation is straightforward. Many people – perhaps most people – really do believe in this model. No struggle.  No Groan Zone.  No problems.  Just a clean, linear, predictable  forward movement from the inception of an idea to the end of its  implementation. And the reason the model is so widely credible is simple:  most of the time, it  works!  In other words, most of the decisions a group makes are routine.   The issues are familiar, the solutions are obvious, and the implementation  can be accomplished with a bare minimum of planning and organizing. Not all problems are routine, though.  And what most people don’t realize  is that this model does not work when the problem is a difficult one.

When a group attempts to solve a difficult problem as though it were a  routine problem, they will very likely make a decision that simply does not  work.  The implementation will break down, and the group will find itself,  sooner or later, back where it began. Groups that pressure themselves to solve a tough problem with a  conventional business-as-usual discussion frequently produce “pseudo- solutions” – ideas that sound good at the time, but are ridiculous in  retrospect.  Here are some common pseudo-solutions: •  Agree on the top 20 priorities •  Delegate a job to someone who is already too overworked to do it •  Establish a policy that has no accountability built into it •  Create a committee to do the same work all over again •  Create a program and don’t fund it •  Make an agreement that will be vetoed by someone who is not present •  Agree to “try harder” from now on Pseudo-solutions don’t solve anything; they merely provide participants  with an illusory feeling of closure, so people can believe they accomplished  something without having to go through the Groan Zone.

Here’s a case in point. A TYPICAL TALE OF WOE The owner of a large urban  department store had a  problem:  his salespeople were  consistently late for work.  The  owner had tried everything he  could think of – fines, threats,  pleading – but nothing worked.  So he called a storewide staff  meeting to tackle the problem.   The meeting began in good  spirits.  Many participants had  an opinion about what the  “real problem” was, and they  were eager to state their views.   There appeared to be two  camps.  One group, including  most floor managers and  supervisors, believed that the  owner hired too many students  to work part-time.  Students,  they said, are transient – not  committed to the long-term  health of the business.  If  supervisors were free to hire  more full-time employees, they  could instill the staff with more  loyalty, better morale, and  higher standards of discipline. The other group, including  most salespeople, said that the  problem was caused by the way  they were paid.  They were on  commission, and very few  shoppers appeared before mid- morning.  Therefore, said the  salespeople, they rarely earned  any money for the first hour of  the day.  They recommended   that those who opened the  store should be paid a few extra  dollars per day for their work. The store owner listened as the  two sides debated each other.   After a while, people’s patience  began to wear thin.  No one  seemed to be changing their  mind, and the group hadn’t  found any new ideas. The  group saw no point in  continuing.  Someone said,  “Everyone can’t always get  what they want.  Sometimes  there are winners and losers,  and we just have to bite the  bullet.”  So the owner said,   “Here’s my proposal.  For the  next four months, everyone  who works on the first floor  will be paid extra for coming  on time.  If it works, I will do it  storewide.  If it doesn’t work, I  will switch policies and hire  more full-time employees.   How does this sound?”  A few  people said, “Fine” or “Let’s try  it.”  The owner asked for  objections, got none, and said,  “All right, we’re agreed.” After the meeting most people  felt that the salespeople “won”  and the managers “lost.”  The  salespeople were glad for the  extra pay and pleased that their  concerns had been heard.  But  the supervisors were irritated.   They felt the owner had not  respected their judgment and  that their authority had been  undermined. Over the next few months, the  part-time students were treated  very poorly.  If someone asked  to work Thursday and Friday,  that person was scheduled to  work Monday and Tuesday.  If  they asked to work evenings,  they got mornings.  The  students reacted predictably:  by  taking long breaks; by spending  too much time on personal  phone calls; by calling in sick at  the last minute; by quitting on  two days’ notice.  The full-time  sales staff saw what was  happening and reacted by  complaining more than ever.   Morale on the first floor  dropped to an all-time low.  Four months later, the owner  ended the experiment and told  the managers to hire more full- time staff.  They were relieved.   Now, with a better workforce,  they could move forward on  their goals of improving morale  and loyalty and instilling  higher standards of discipline.   But the sales staff were  resentful.  They felt they’d been  robbed of extra income by a  management that had  sabotaged the agreement.  They  told newly hired employees,  “Don’t trust your boss; he is a  jerk.”  Tensions lingered for  years.  And the original problem  – coming to work late – grew  even worse, and was never  resolved.     CASE STUDY     Community At Work  © 2007     195     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  When a group makes a commitment to engage in participatory decision- making, the process can produce meaningful, integrated, broadly supported  solutions to exceedingly difficult problems.  The keys are to resource it  properly, and stay committed to the process.  Here’s a real-life example.* SUSTAINABLE AGREEMENTS SUCCESS  STORY In Mendocino County,  California, local authorities  brought together a group of  loggers, environmentalists, and  government officials to try to  resolve a longstanding quarrel  over the fate of privately  owned redwood groves. Until 1975 the property tax on  privately owned forest land was  based on the number of  standing trees.  The more trees  on your property, the more tax  you paid.  To give the lumber  companies an incentive to  replant, all redwood trees  under forty years old were  exempt from the tax.  But this  policy had an unintended  consequence:  it created an  incentive to cut down all older  redwood trees, including  ancient redwoods, whether or  not the wood was in demand. Environmentalists proposed  taxing all redwoods, regardless  of age.  Lumber companies  opposed this proposal. They  argued that it would discourage  them from replanting.  Further,  it would induce them to cut  down even more trees – fewer  standing trees would mean  fewer taxes.  Many residents of  Mendocino County were  advocates for preserving old- growth forests, and the county  politicians felt pressured to  find a workable solution.   Accordingly they created a task  force with representatives from  all factions.  The task force was  charged with developing a  proposal for revising the tax   code.  The proposal would then  be submitted to the California  State legislature for approval. The first meetings of the task  force were polarized.  The  loggers insisted that the  environmentalists’ proposal  would wreak havoc on the  local economy, which  depended heavily on the  viability of the lumber  business.  Environmentalists  retorted that the lumber  companies were mercenary and  short-sighted, and that they  failed to protect the needs of  the local ecosystem.   Many observers doubted that  the group could produce a  proposal that would make it  through the legislative  gauntlet.  (Ten committees had  to approve the bill – providing  special-interest lobbyists ample  opportunity to stall a proposal  they didn’t agree with.)  But  the conveners of the task force  were determined to overcome  the odds.  They provided  encouragement and staff  support, so the group could  keep working to find a solution  that would be agreeable to all  parties.  They knew that letting  the dispute persist would lead  to costly legal battles, a divided  community, and various  potential disruptions in the  local economy. Over the next few months, the  task force met regularly. They  gradually relaxed their  posturing and became more  willing to search for common  ground.  As they became more  familiar with each other’s  points of view, their discussion  became more interesting and  more insightful.  It took them several months,  but they found a creative  framework:  What if they  stopped calculating property  tax based on standing trees and  switched to a tax based on cut  lumber?  This would discourage  lumber companies from  logging more than they could  immediately market.  By  removing the tax on standing  trees, land owners were no  longer penalized for preserving  ancient redwoods. They developed a formal  proposal and sent it to the  legislature.  Since it was  supported by all sides, the  proposal sailed through all ten  legislative committees without  opposition. The bill passed  quickly, became law, and the  entire community benefited.  CASE STUDY  This case study was told to Sam Kaner by a former lumber industry lobbyist who was a member of  the task force described here. *    Community At Work  © 2007    196   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    What went wrong at the department store staff meeting?  Not only did the  participants fail to solve the tardiness problem, but their course of action  bred long-lasting animosity and cynicism.  The above diagram offers insight  into the reasons their meeting produced such poor outcomes. Not realizing how much effort it would take to find a sustainable agreement,  the group engaged in a business-as-usual decision-making process.  They  arrived at a decision without ever breaking out of the narrow band of  familiar opinions to hunt for creative options.  No one, for example, even  raised the possibility of opening the store an hour later.  Nor did anyone  suggest simple but offbeat ideas, such as offering free cappuccino to early- morning shoppers.  Rather than search for alternatives, the group focused on  two conventional approaches:  people stated their own points of view  without thinking too deeply about the larger implications of their opinions,    or they repeated their arguments until nothing new was being said.  No one  attempted to take the other side’s needs into account.  The owner, who  expected to reach closure at that meeting, suggested a proposal and then  made a superficial effort to check for group agreement.  Thus, the group  reached a quick decision – quick, but entirely ineffective.    TIME  Business as Usual NEW TOPIC ✔ FAMILIAR OPINIONS DECISION POINT GROUP DECISION-MAKING AT THE DEPARTMENT STORE STAFF MEETING BUSINESS AS USUAL    Community At Work  © 2007     197     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  GROUP DECISION-MAKING AT THE PROPERTY TAX TASK FORCE MEETING PARTICIPATORY PROCESS What made the second case turn out so differently?  After all, the problem  itself was much more difficult:  the stakes were higher, the competing  interest groups were more powerful, and the overall structure for reaching  closure was incomparably more complicated.  Yet the parties were able to  find a creative solution that was genuinely acceptable to all sets of  stakeholders.  The diagram above is a rough schematic representation of the  type of decision-making process this group engaged in.     Recognizing that they had a difficult problem on their hands, this group did  not try to solve the problem in a meeting or two; instead they created a  structure that allowed them to keep working for as long as it took to solve  the problem.  As for the decision-making authority, they saw that all parties  would have to agree to the final decision or it wouldn’t work.  This, in turn,  allowed them to survive the rocky start.  Once they broke out of the narrow  band – which in their case was marked by arguments between factions – it  was inevitable that they would enter the Groan Zone.  They had to struggle,  sometimes for entire meetings, to understand one another’s perspectives.   Over time, they built a shared framework of understanding, which allowed  them to create a solution that incorporated everyone’s point of view.

Closure Zone    Community At Work  © 2007    198   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    TWO MIND-SETS FOR SOLVING PROBLEMS Why did the results of the department store staff meeting turn out so poorly,  compared to the results of the property tax task force?  Part of the answer to  this question is obvious:  they organized themselves differently.  The people at  the department store held a single meeting:  business as usual.  They gave  themselves a chance to air familiar opinions; then they brought the issue to  closure.  In contrast, the members of the property tax task force designed a  participatory process that allowed their problem-solving process to unfold in  stages.  They too began by airing familiar opinions – but they created a  structure that supported people to move beyond their starting positions and  build a shared framework of understanding. But this tells us what they did, not why they did it.  Why, in other words, did  the two groups organize themselves so differently?  The answer is that each  group was operating from a different mind-set for solving problems:  one  group had an Either/Or mind-set; the other group had a Both/And mind-set.  From an Either/Or mind-set, solving a problem is a matter of making a choice  among competing alternatives.  Either you choose option “A” or you choose  option “B” – someone wins and someone loses, and that’s how it goes.  From  a Both/And mind-set, solving a problem is a matter of finding an inclusive  solution – one that encompasses everyone’s point of view.  Rather than  choosing between options “A” and “B,” you search for a brand-new  alternative that is satisfactory to everyone. Groups that operate from an Either/Or mind-set are in a hurry.  They want to  get the decision over with.  After all, what’s the point of going over and over  the same territory?  Once the range of options has been clarified, further  discussion becomes irrelevant.  But groups that operate from a Both/And  mind-set place a higher value on effectiveness than on expedience.   If the original range of options can provide the group with a workable  solution, then great!  Decisions that can be made quickly should be made  quickly.  But if the original range of options does not provide a workable  solution, then more work lies ahead.  The goal in such groups is not merely  to reach a decision, but to reach a sustainable agreement – that is, to find a  solution that works.   Several characteristics of these two mind-sets are contrasted on the next page.

Community At Work  © 2007    200   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    This diagram represents the process of building sustainable agreements.  Up  to the point of decision, progress is slow – much slower than anyone expects  – as the members of the group struggle to develop a shared framework of  understanding.  The implementation, on the other hand, is often  interesting, exciting, and challenging – rather than painful.  Bringing a  sustainable agreement to fruition is like swimming with the tide instead of  against it.  People feel confident that their efforts are headed toward results. What is it that makes a sustainable agreement sustainable?  The answer is  that the agreement is based on a solution that incorporates everyone’s point  of view.  Participants would say, “Yes, this works!  From my perspective, this  proposal actually does solve the problem.”   How does a group achieve this?  By patient, persistent effort.  People keep  working to understand one another’s goals and needs and fears and frames  of reference.  They face conflicts and overcome them; they explore  possibilities by putting themselves in each other’s shoes; they challenge  their underlying assumptions; they search for imaginative solutions.  And  they share responsibility for reaching a result that works for everyone.  SHARED UNDERSTANDING WHAT MAKES AN AGREEMENT SUSTAINABLE ?

Community At Work  © 2007     201     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  Groups need different types of support at different points in the process.   Facilitators who understand this will vary their technique accordingly.   Different zones call for different tools and skills. For example, it is unwise to promote convergent thinking in a group whose  members have not yet built a shared framework of understanding.  They will  probably not trust solutions proposed by their opponents, because they do  not yet feel personally understood by one another.  On the other hand, if  members are able to take each other’s needs into account, they might  benefit greatly from a structured thinking activity that helps them hunt for  inclusive solutions.  The preceding chapters of this book have introduced the fundamental skills  of group facilitation.  Skills like listening, chartwriting, and process  management are useful in every zone.  But there are also many facilitation  tools that are designed to work in a specific zone.  Dozens of these tools are  presented in the next three chapters. ✔ NEW TOPIC ?

At this phase of the  discussion, the facilitator does not even try to resolve disagreements.  S/he  honors everything everyone says and refrains from asking participants to  revise or reconsider their opinions.   Structured thinking activities like the ones presented in this chapter can be  very helpful in the Divergent Zone.  Structure serves as a container.  It can  allow members to express a wide range of opinions without fearing that  their diversity will overwhelm the group’s resources.  People sense this, and  they feel relief at the thought that the process is “under control.”  For this  reason, many groups are pleased to be given an opportunity to do  structured thinking in the Divergent Zone.  Facilitators can offer their  suggestions with confidence that they will usually be well received. ✔ NEW TOPIC Divergent Zone ? Groan Zone Business as Usual Convergent Zone Closure Zone DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES FAMILIAR OPINIONS ATTEMPTED  DECISION GATHERING DIVERSE POINTS OF VIEW  INTRODUCTION    Community At Work  © 2007     205     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  GATHERING DIVERSE POINTS OF VIEW  Whenever a group is engaged in divergent thinking, the members are  increasing the diversity of the material they can work with.  Divergent  thinking expands the range of the ideas that can be discussed further.  This  principle holds true whether group members are engaged in a boisterous  round of brainstorming or whether they are nervously sharing their  individual reactions to a painful controversy.  In either case, their activity  will result in the emergence of a greater diversity of perspectives.  This is the  defining property of the Divergent Zone. Nonetheless, not all divergent thinking is the same.  There are different types  of divergent thinking, and each has its own characteristics.  The three most  common types are:  Surveying the Territory, Searching for Alternatives, and  Raising Difficult Issues.    Type 1:  Surveying the Territory Surveying the Territory involves identifying the components of the problem  under discussion.  For example, suppose a group is facing a contentious  dispute. If every group member takes a turn stating his or her position,  everyone will get an initial impression of the complexity of the conflict.   The essence of this type of divergent thinking is collecting perspectives. Type 2:  Searching for Alternatives Searching for Alternatives refers to the creative activity of listing unusual,  innovative ideas.  Some ideas on the list will prove to be realistic; many will  not.  The essence of this type of divergent thinking is generating ideas. Type 3:  Raising Difficult Issues Raising Difficult Issues involves the discussion of a troubling – often  threatening – subject.  Some groups treat the members who raise difficult  issues as troublemakers; deviations from the party line are squelched.  But  other groups make an effort to respond to someone who raises a difficult  issue by sharing the risk and encouraging everyone to disclose his or her  individual perspective.  The ensuing discussion usually turns out to be quite  meaningful.  The essence of this type of divergent thinking is speaking freely.  THREE TYPES OF THINKING IN THE DIVERGENT ZONE    Community At Work  © 2007    206   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    Surveying the Territory is the most common – and the most essential – type of  divergent thinking.  It involves identifying components of the problem  under discussion.  The basic question on people’s minds is something like,  “How complex is this problem?” or “What are we dealing with here?” The simplest way to help a group survey the territory is by suggesting a  go-around.  This gives people the opportunity to hear the range of different  objectives, problems, questions, and feelings that might be connected to the  subject at hand.   By the time the go-around ends, the overall scope of the  group’s task will have become much more visible. Sometimes a simple go-around will not provide the group with enough  direction.  For example, one group might need to find out whether there are  different goals in the room; another group might need to find out whether  the right people are in the room.  This is a perfect opportunity for the  facilitator to suggest a structured thinking activity that can help the group  Survey the Territory.  Six such activities are described in the following pages. NEW TOPIC DECISION POINT ? Surveying the Territory SURVEYING THE TERRITORY DIVERGENT ZONE THINKING ACTIVITY:  TYPE 1    Community At Work  © 2007     207     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  This is a basic, straightforward activity that encourages participants to  offer their own points of view on the topic at hand. The purpose of this activity is to enable members to quickly gain a  picture of the breadth of the group’s thinking.  By seeing all the parts,  the group gains a sense of the whole. Another purpose of the activity is to legitimize and validate every  perspective.  By allowing the group to hear each person’s contribution,  this activity sends the message that “Everyone has something to offer.” 1.  Pose an open-ended question such as:   •  How would you describe what’s going on?   •  How does this problem affect you?   •  What is your position on this matter?   •  Why, in your opinion, is this happening? 2.  Ask each person to answer the question without commenting on each  other’s ideas. 3.  Close the activity by asking participants for their reactions, general  comments and learnings. 4.  Optional Step:   When everyone has had a chance to express their views, ask,   “Is there anyone absent today who might have a significantly different  perspective?  What might that person tell us?”  WHY   HOW  SPEAK FROM YOUR OWN PERSPECTIVE  SURVEYING THE TERRITORY     Community At Work  © 2007    208   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING     SURVEYING THE TERRITORY  SPECIFYING REQUIREMENTS 1.  Hang two sheets of chart paper, one titled “Requirements and  Necessary Conditions” and the other “Topics for Further Discussion.”   2. Break the group into pairs.  Ask each person to take a turn describing  his or her own requirements and necessary conditions for success. 3. Reconvene the large group.  Give each person three minutes to state  his or her requirements and five minutes to answer questions.   Record each requirement on the chart paper.  Questions that would  require further discussion are also recorded. 4.  After repeating Step 3 for each person, have the group examine the  lists and decide how to organize the subsequent discussion. When tackling a difficult problem, different stakeholders bring different  requirements to the table.  To be sustainable, the eventual solution must  take into account every stakeholder’s requirements.  For example, an  appliance manufacturing company held a product design meeting to  discuss the development of a new, low-energy light bulb.  The  purchasing department wanted the bulb to be built from parts and  materials that were readily available.  The marketing department  insisted that the shape of the bulb had to fit in standardized packaging.  The engineering department wanted precise timetables from research  and development so they would know how to schedule their staff.  And  the company president wanted assurance that the new product would  be a salable commodity.  For groups like these, the challenge is to take stock of all requirements  before getting bogged down in specifics.  This activity helps a group to  gain a preliminary understanding of everyone’s conditions for success.   WHY   HOW     Community At Work  © 2007     209     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING   WHY   HOW   SURVEYING THE TERRITORY  WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, AND HOW? When solving problems in groups, people come to the table with very  different questions based on their individual perspectives.  Since everyone  wants their own questions answered, they often have trouble recognizing  that many, many questions – not just their own –  need to be answered.   This element of divergent thinking is one of the most difficult aspects of  group decision-making. At a recent meeting, for example, one person who was mystified by the  budgeting process requested clarifications and explanations repeatedly.   Another asked several questions about the reasons why certain people had  been invited to the meeting while others had not.  A third person  appeared to understand everything but one little detail, about which he  kept asking questions.  Each was focused on his or her own questions and  could not see that others were struggling with entirely different questions. This activity supports a group to identify the whole range of questions  before they get too focused on wrestling with any single question. 1.  Hang five sheets of paper titled respectively, “Who?” “What?”  “When?” “Where?” and “How?” 2.  Start by naming the general topic.  For example, “We’re now going to  start planning the annual staff retreat.” 3.  On the “Who?” page, brainstorm a list of questions that begin with  “Who?”  For example, “Who will set the agenda?”  “Who knows  someone who can rent us a conference room?” “Who should be  invited?” “Who said we can’t spend more than $500?” 4.  Repeat Step 3 for each of the other sheets. 5.  When all five lists are complete, identify the easy questions and  answer them.  Then make a plan to answer the rest. This tool was inspired by an exercise called “Five W’s and H” in A. B. VanGundy, Jr., Techniques of  Structured Problem Solving, 2nd ed. (New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1988), p. 46.      Community At Work  © 2007    210   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    FACTS AND OPINIONS  SURVEYING THE TERRITORY  This activity enables a group to trade a lot of information without getting  bogged down in a discussion of who is right or what is true. For example, suppose a group needed to begin thinking about next year’s  budget.  Facts and Opinions would help them to generate numerical  statistics (“last year we spent $4,000 on legal fees”) and speculation (“we  might want to initiate two new lawsuits next year”) both within a short  period of time. Note that in this example, Facts and Opinions postpones the debate over  the budget.  Instead, the thrust of the exercise is to gather a lot of  material on many different subjects.  Once group members see the big  picture, they can decide which topics to discuss and in what order.  WHY   HOW  1.  To prepare for this activity, hang two large pieces of paper on a wall.   Title one “Facts” and the other “Opinions.”  Also, make available  sticky notes in two colors, with enough for every member to receive at  least ten of each color. 2.  Ask the group members, “What do you know about this topic?”  Have  each group member write his or her answers on the sticky notes, using  one color for “Facts” and the other color for “Opinions.”  (If asked  how to know whether something is a fact or an opinion, answer,  “Please decide for yourself.  If you’re not sure, write it both ways.”) 3.  Have each person post his or her sticky notes on the wall. The notes  should be posted as soon as they are written, so everyone can read the  posted notes whenever they like.  Reading often prompts new  thinking.  Participants can continue posting ideas until time is up. 4.  After all data have been collected, ask the group for their observations  and reflections.    Community At Work  © 2007     211     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  STARTING POSITIONS  SURVEYING THE TERRITORY  This activity is perfect for helping people deal with a contentious issue  – especially when their conflict is fueled by a wide range of opposing  perspectives. When people are brought together to resolve a dispute, many participants  arrive with strong opinions and well-rehearsed arguments.  They need to  be given a chance to express their opinions fully, so they can let everyone  else see where they stand. When people aren’t able to speak without being interrupted or  discounted, it is predictable that they will insert their positions into the  discussion at every opportunity.  Conversely, when people are supported  to state their positions fully, they frequently become more able to listen  to one another.  This often leads to better mutual understanding, which  is a precondition for finding creative solutions to difficult problems. 1.  Introduce the activity by indicating that there may be several diverse  perspectives in the room.  Encourage everyone to give each other the  time and the attention each person needs to express his or her views. 2.  Using a go-around format, ask each speaker to take a turn answering  the following questions from his or her individual perspective:   •  What is the problem and what solution is s/he advocating?   •  What are his or her reasons for taking this particular position?   Note:  This step is often done by having each speaker come up to the  front of the room and present his or her ideas standing up. 3.  When each person has had a turn, ask the group for observations and  reflections.  WHY   HOW     Community At Work  © 2007    212   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    People in a group often share so many assumptions in common that  they may not recognize their own blind spots.  Yet omitting a key  perspective can ruin the outcome of an otherwise participatory process.   For example, in the 1980s, urban-based environmental organizations, in  collaboration with state and federal agencies, drew up many unpopular  and ultimately unacceptable proposals for rural conservation.  These  plans were rarely supported by the loggers or miners whose livelihoods  were being threatened.  In many cases, the plans were unworkable  because they had been designed without adequate understanding of the  needs and goals of the working people in the affected communities. This activity assists a group to determine whether there are stakeholders  whose perspective should be better represented at future meetings. 1.  List every group of stakeholders that might be affected by this  problem.  Don’t forget to include less-than-obvious stakeholders.  For  example, does your issue affect trainees?  Suppliers?  Neighbors?  Does  it affect the families of employees?  For this activity, every affected  stakeholder group matters. 2.  One by one, go down the list considering each group in the following  way:  “How does the situation at hand affect this stakeholder group?”   Example:  “How does our project expansion for next year affect our  trainees?” 3.  When the list is complete ask, “Has anyone spotted a problem that  wasn’t previously identified?” and “Is there someone missing from  these meetings who should be included from now on?”  WHY   HOW  UNREPRESENTED PERSPECTIVES  SURVEYING THE TERRITORY     Community At Work  © 2007     213     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  Searching for Alternatives involves generating lists of creative ideas for the  purpose of discovering new ways of approaching the problem at hand.  The most straightforward way to help a group search for alternatives is by  leading them through a brainstorming session.  To do this, ask the group to  state the question they want the brainstorm to answer.  Record that question  on a flipchart, then review the ground rules of brainstorming, and begin.  Have someone else do the chartwriting if possible, so you can focus on using  your facilitative listening skills:  mirroring, paraphrasing, and gathering ideas. Often a brainstorming session will produce exactly what is needed:  some  new rough ideas that are worth further discussion.  But there are times when  people are so stuck in their fixed positions that not even brainstorming can  help them break free of their rigid mental models.  Many structured creative  thinking activities are available to help deal effectively with this exact  situation.  A sampling of these activities can be found on the next pages.   Many others, along with a wonderfully lucid and useful explanation of the  underlying cognitive process of creative thinking, can be found in the work  of Edward de Bono, including his masterpiece, Lateral Thinking (1970).

It can be a great leader, a fictional  character, a typical customer –  anyone who is not in the room. 2. Pose the question, and review the  ground rules for brainstorming.  3. Instruct half the members to  participate in the brainstorming  from the perspective of their  imaginary character, while the  other half give contributions from  their own real-life perspectives. 4.  After a few minutes, switch roles.   Thus, the former roleplayers now  leave their roles, and the others  assume the roles chosen earlier. 5.  Debrief.  Discuss any insights  obtained. ROLESTORMING ANALOGS 1.  Have participants generate a list of  situations or conditions that are  analogous to the problem at hand.  For  example, suppose a group’s goal is to  increase its funding.  Members could  list other types of growth – plant growth,  growth of a city, and so on.  2. Have the group pick one of the analogs  and describe it in detail, listing uses,   functions, parts, and so on.  Continuing  the preceding example:  plants have  roots; they reproduce via seeds; and  their growth is seasonal and cyclical. 3. Now encourage the group to consider  each analogy in the light of the original  problem.  Example:  Are any new ideas  for fundraising suggested by thinking   about a plant’s seasonal cycles?  Its root  structure?  Its reproduction by seeds? Source: R. E. Griggs, “A Storm of Ideas,”   Training, 22 (1985):56. Source:  E. de Bono, Lateral Thinking  (New York:  Harper and Row, 1970).    Community At Work  © 2007    216   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    Raising Difficult Issues refers to the initial surfacing of risky subjects – the act  of bringing them up for the first time.  Issues such as an ongoing feud  between key parties or a poor decision that everyone dislikes but no one  wants to revisit are seldom placed on an agenda forthrightly.  Rather, they  typically surface in the cracks of a related discussion.  Someone might say,  “Can we talk about what is really causing this problem?”  Then s/he names  the unspeakable issue, hoping that others will participate in exploring the  subject.  But often, they do no such thing!  People frequently become  anxious and change the subject or withdraw.  This places the person who  did speak up in a tough position – as though s/he were the only one who felt  that his or her points were relevant.  The following activities provide an alternative.  Rather than treat this  situation as a dilemma that occurs after one person takes a risk, each activity  offers participants the opportunity to share the load of surfacing difficult  issues.  Each activity offers a structured, low-pressure forum in which  members can give voice to the difficult topics that might be on their minds.  NEW TOPIC DECISION POINT ? Raising Difficult Issues RAISING DIFFICULT ISSUES DIVERGENT ZONE THINKING ACTIVITY:  TYPE 3    Community At Work  © 2007     217     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  1. Describe this activity.  Explain why people can benefit from structured  activities that give them permission to speak up.  Obtain agreement  from the group to proceed.  2. Have the group break into pairs.  Ask each partner to answer this  question:  “During this discussion, have I had any thoughts I haven’t  said aloud?”  Assure people that no one is required to say anything  they don’t want to say. 3. Next, ask everyone (still in pairs) to answer this question:  “Would the  group benefit from hearing your partner’s thinking?” 4. Return to the large group.  Ask for volunteers to share any of their  own thoughts that might be useful for others to hear. People refrain from saying what they’re really thinking for a wide variety  of reasons.  Sometimes they hold back because the risk is too great.  But  people also keep quiet because they aren’t sure whether their ideas are  worth saying or because they can’t turn the kernels of their ideas into  fully formed presentations.  In other words, there are many occasions  when group members – if they were given a little support, a little  permission, a little nudge – might go ahead and say what’s on their  mind.  Yet without that support, they often stay quiet. This activity helps group members take a look at the thoughts they’ve  been having (but not speaking) during a discussion.  It also gives  members an opportunity to reflect on whether the group would be  served if a person did open up and share his or her perspective.  WHY   HOW  IS THERE ANYTHING I’M NOT SAYING?  RAISING DIFFICULT ISSUES     Community At Work  © 2007    218   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    This activity supports people to react to a problem on a personal level by  giving people permission to express their fears, confusions, hurts, or  resentments openly.  The activity helps people become more aware of  what they’re feeling so they can discuss the situation in more depth. Also, this activity enables people to step back from their own individual  perspective and see a bigger picture.  It is frequently surprising and highly  informative for them to hear what other people are feeling. 1.  Ask people to reflect on the following questions:     •  “How do I feel about this situation?”     •  “How has it affected me so far?” 2.  Ask each person to take a turn sharing his or her reflections and  feelings with the whole group.  A go-around format works best for this  activity because it discourages back-and-forth discussion.   3.  When everyone has spoken, ask the whole group, “Now that you have  heard from everyone else, what reactions are you having?”     4.  If responses indicate that this activity has surfaced a lot of emotion,  encourage the group to do a second go-around.  Say something like,  “Use this time to let the rest of us know whatever is on your mind.” 5.  End by summarizing the main themes.  Validating everyone’s self- disclosure helps provide people with a temporary sense of completion,  even when the source problems remain obviously unresolved.  WHY   HOW  HOW HAS THIS AFFECTED ME?  RAISING DIFFICULT ISSUES     Community At Work  © 2007     219     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  THREE COMPLAINTS  RAISING DIFFICULT ISSUES  1.  Give the group an overview of the upcoming steps.  Then have each  individual write on a separate slip of paper three complaints about the  situation under discussion. 2. Have everyone throw the slips of paper into a hat. 3. Pull out one note, read it aloud, and ask for comments.  The author  may or may not wish to identify himself or herself. 4. After three or four comments, pull out another complaint and repeat  the process. 5. After 10 or 15 minutes, ask the group how much longer they would  like this activity to continue. 6. When time runs out, ask people to close by saying what the  experience was like for them. Giving people the opportunity to complain about their situation has two  powerful results.  People have a chance to say things that are normally  not acceptable.  Often useful information is revealed about a situation  that would otherwise remain hidden. Second, when people have a chance to vent their negative feelings  instead of stewing in them, they are more able to move forward on a task. After an activity like this one, it is common for people to make significant  progress on the topic under discussion.  WHY   HOW     Community At Work  © 2007    220   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    GATHERING DIVERSE POINTS OF VIEW  NEW TOPIC DECISION POINT ? Raising Difficult Issues Surveying the Territory Searching for Alternatives ATTEMPTED DECISION ✔ DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES FAMILIAR OPINIONS  TIME  The most common types of divergent thinking are shown above.  Each type  can be supported by activities like those presented in this chapter.   Some  activities help a group gain a better picture of the scope of the task at hand.   Others enable a group to create a list of unusual ideas.  Still others support  participants to uncover and then discuss topics that are uncomfortable. Structured activities are often useful in the Divergent Zone – but because they  are so highly directive, they are not always the preferred approach.   Sometimes people simply want to engage in conversation.  On those  occasions, the facilitator can rely on nondirective techniques, using  listening skills like paraphrasing, drawing people out, stacking, encouraging, and  making space, all of which support divergent thinking.   No matter what approach s/he takes, the facilitator’s main task in the  Divergent Zone is to support everyone to speak up and state his or her    point of view.  This is a prerequisite for building sustainable agreements.

ATTEMPTED DECISION Business as Usual Convergent Zone Closure Zone Divergent Zone The facilitator’s main objective in the Groan Zone is to help the group  develop a shared framework of understanding.  This is anything but easy.   The greater the divergence of opinions in the room, the greater is the chance  for confusion and misinterpretation.  The facilitator should concentrate on  promoting mutual understanding.  This takes a lot of careful, responsive  listening; at times, the facilitator may be the only person in the room who is  listening at all. Whether the facilitator is helping one person stand up to pressure from  others, or helping two people clear up a misunderstanding between them, or  helping a whole group focus on the same thing at the same time, the overall  goal remains constant:  support the group to keep working.  Don’t let the group  give in to the temptation to make a pseudo-decision.  Instead, help them  keep struggling to integrate each other’s points of view.     Community At Work  © 2007     223     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  BUILDING A SHARED FRAMEWORK OF UNDERSTANDING After a period of divergent thinking, most groups enter the Groan Zone.   Suppose, for example, the members have just finished a brainstorming  process.  In theory, the group’s next task seems simple:  sift through all the  ideas, and discuss a few more in depth.  But in practice that task is often  grueling.  Everyone has his or her own unique frame of reference, and  communication can easily break down.  Moreover, when people  misunderstand one another, their behavior often becomes more confused,  more impatient, more self-centered – more unpleasant all around.   This phase of work is truly difficult to tolerate.  It is a normal, natural period  – but it’s still a struggle.  The effort to understand one another’s perspectives  and build a shared framework of understanding – this struggle in the service of  integration – is the defining work of the Groan Zone.    Most groups flee from the Groan Zone long before they have developed the  capacity to think together.  This is reflected in the quality of their decisions.   Those who do persevere discover that what enabled them to survive the  struggle were the periods they spent learning to understand each other.   The development of a shared framework of understanding centers around  two types of thinking:  Creating Shared Context and Strengthening  Relationships.  Both types are discussed in this chapter.  Type 1:  Creating Shared Context Creating Shared Context refers to activities that directly advance mutual  understanding.  This can be done in a variety of ways:  by acquiring shared  experiences, by developing shared language, by surfacing background  information, and by making efforts to put oneself in the other person’s  shoes.  In all cases the purpose is to enable people to think from each other’s  point of view.  The essence of this type of activity is understanding. Type 2:  Strengthening Relationships Strengthening Relationships refers to activities that support people to get to  know each other.  It is easier to listen to a person’s thinking when one has  experienced that person’s humanity.  The essence of this type of activity is  interpersonal communication. TWO TYPES OF THINKING IN THE GROAN ZONE    Community At Work  © 2007    224   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    CREATING SHARED CONTEXT GROAN ZONE THINKING ACTIVITY:  TYPE 1 In order for a group to develop sustainable agreements that take everyone’s  interests into account, the participants must be able to think from one  another’s points of view.  They do not have to agree with someone else’s  perspective, but they do have to understand it.  The simplest way to help group members gain a deeper understanding of  each other’s perspectives is to encourage them to ask direct questions of one  another and listen carefully to the answers.    But some participants fear that asking questions might appear  confrontational or rude, especially when the speaker’s statements were  controversial or difficult to understand.  Furthermore, many people simply  can’t tolerate the ambiguity of unstructured inquiry and dialogue for very  long.  Thus many groups require structured thinking activities to help them  learn more about each other’s frames of reference.  The following pages  present seven tools that support group members to create shared context. NEW TOPIC DECISION POINT ? Creating Shared Context    Community At Work  © 2007     225     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING   HOW  1.  Ask for a volunteer to be the “focal person.”  S/he begins by saying,  “Here’s the point I want to make.”  S/he has three minutes to talk. 2.  When s/he is done, encourage someone to ask a question, like, “What  do you mean by . . . ?” or, “Can you explain why . . . ?” or something  similar. 3.  The focal person then answers the first question. 4.  Turn to the questioner, and ask, “Is this clear to you now?”  If so,  continue to Step 5.  If not, ask the questioner to state, first, what s/he  believes the focal person has said, and then what s/he still finds  unclear.  For example, someone might say, “I hear the focal person  saying that we should all share the cleanup chores equally.  But I still  don’t understand why he feels so strongly about it.” 5.  When both the questioner and the focal person feel understood, ask for  another questioner to take a turn. 6.  After three or four people have had a chance to ask questions, ask for  another person to volunteer to be the new focal person.   The goal of this activity is to promote understanding, not to resolve  differences.  This should be emphasized beforehand and, if necessary,  throughout the activity.  WHY  LEARNING MORE ABOUT EACH OTHER’S PERSPECTIVES  CREATING SHARED CONTEXT  The most basic method for promoting mutual understanding is to ask  questions.  Sometimes, however, people hesitate to ask questions about  each other’s perspectives because questioning is so often perceived as  criticism.  By providing structure, this activity helps people understand  that the questions are not intended as attacks. Facilitators often hesitate to use a tool like this one because it eats up  precious meeting time.  But the alternative – trying to proceed in the  absence of understanding – ends up consuming much more time, with  much worse results.  Using this simple tool builds trust and patience, and  it significantly improves mutual understanding.    Community At Work  © 2007    226   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    1. Have the group choose a statement to work with.  The statement  should begin with the words, “If I were you . . .”  For example, two  common choices are, “If I were you, a main concern of mine would   be . . .” or “If I were you, one of my goals would be . . .” 2. Write each member’s name on two separate slips of paper, and put  them into a hat. 3.  Have each person draw out two slips, so that each person has the  names of two different people.  (If a person pulls his or her own name,  s/he puts it back or trades with someone.) 4.  Give everyone a turn being the focal person.  When someone is the  focal person, the two people who have that person’s name say to him  or her, “If I were you . . .”   5.  After listening to both people, the focal person may respond. 6.  When everyone has had a turn, ask the group members to reflect on  the activity and share any new insights they have gained.  WHY   HOW  IF I WERE YOU  CREATING SHARED CONTEXT  Another straightforward way to promote mutual understanding is to  have people look at the world through each other’s eyes. Exploring someone else’s perspective helps people to suspend their own  points of view.  This activity thus provides some participants with  insights that they may not have acquired through conventional  discussion.  Furthermore, the process supports participants to feel understood and  “seen.”  If necessary, it allows them the opportunity to correct any  misperceptions.    Community At Work  © 2007     227     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  When an argument seems to be going around in circles, it can be  extremely helpful for everyone to stop arguing over proposed “solutions”  and start talking about their individual needs instead. For example, consider a dispute between three administrators over  whether to schedule an important meeting in New York or Boston.  The  problem (where to meet) had two solutions (New York or Boston).  But  beneath the superficial solutions were everyone’s individual needs.  One  person needed to stay near his office as much as possible because his  assistant was on vacation.  A second needed to keep her commitment to  attend three other meetings that had long been planned.  A third was  expecting a drop-in visit from the regional director; she needed to be  available “just in case.”  Once everyone understood each other’s needs  more clearly, they stopped imagining that the disagreement was due to  “power struggles” and “turf battles.”  They realized that meeting on a  Saturday would work for everyone no matter where they met. As the example shows, it becomes easier to develop proposals that meet a  broader range of needs when those needs have been made explicit – and,  therefore, understandable to everyone. 1.  Make sure everyone understands the difference between “their  proposed solution” and “their actual need.”  For example, “holding  the meeting in Boston” is a proposed solution; “honoring prior  commitments to attend three other meetings” is a need.  Take time, if  necessary, to teach this distinction to group members. 2.  Ask everyone to answer these questions:  “What are my needs in this  situation?” and “What do I think your needs are?” 3.  Continue until everyone feels satisfied that their own needs have  been stated clearly.  Then ask the group to generate new proposals  that seek to incorporate a broader range of people’s needs.  WHY   HOW  BACKING UP FROM SOLUTIONS TO NEEDS  CREATING SHARED CONTEXT     Community At Work  © 2007    228   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    1. Begin by having each group member identify one or two questions  that, if everyone’s answer were known, would enable that group  member to participate more effectively.  For example, “Do others   think we should be prepared to spend a lot of money on this project?”  2. Ask each person to write his or her question on a sheet of paper.   Collect everyone’s questions and put them in a hat. 3.  Draw out one sheet of paper, read that question, and ask the person  who wrote that question to spend up to two minutes explaining why  he or she wants to understand everyone’s position on that question. 4.  Ask for brief responses from everyone:  “I feel this way because . . .”  When everyone has spoken, draw another question.  If time is short,  the remaining questions can be carried over to the next meeting.  WHY   HOW   CREATING SHARED CONTEXT  Each participant comes to a meeting with his or her own unique set of  interests and concerns.  And in many cases, the participant wants to find  out where others stand on the area of his or her special concern.  For  example, one person may need to know whether other members are  committed to remaining in the group.  Someone else may need to hear  how people feel about the group’s track record on diversity issues.   Another member may want to know people’s attitudes toward retaining a  consultant.   Often, however, it is not clear how or when to raise those issues for  discussion. Any of these themes might be very meaningful to a few  people yet not very meaningful at all, to others.  This creates a dilemma.    How can a group devote sufficient time to such concerns – enough to  prevent individual participants from becoming impatient or distracted  and withdrawn – yet not so much that the agenda becomes derailed by  focusing on topics that seem tangential or low-priority to other  members?  This activity offers a method for balancing the two sets of  concerns by providing members with a chance to make a preliminary  assessment of the attitudes and biases pertaining to their area of interest.  MEANINGFUL THEMES    Community At Work  © 2007     229     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  1.  Identify which members are likely to be affected by the proposal on  the floor.  Ask for a volunteer to become the focal person. 2.  For 3  to 5 minutes, have the group brainstorm answers to the  question:  “If we implement our proposal, how will it affect this  person’s role?”  While the brainstorm is in effect, no disagreements  are allowed.   3.  When time is up, ask the focal person to come to the front of the  room.  S/he educates the group by elaborating on the items s/he  thinks are important for everyone to understand.  Encourage  participants to ask questions.   4.  Have the group choose a second focal person.  Repeat Steps 2 and 3. Sometimes a participant is clearly unhappy with a proposal but s/he  cannot seem to communicate his or her concerns effectively.  The  difficulty may be rooted in the fact that most proposals affect different  roles in different ways.  When participants do not understand the  nuances of one another’s roles – a common state of affairs – they may  have trouble understanding one another’s concerns about a given  proposal.  This activity helps the group focus their whole attention on how a  proposal will affect each participant.  As a result, many confusions and  misunderstandings clear up as people gain insight into the subtle realities  of each other’s situations.  WHY  HOW WILL THIS PROPOSAL  AFFECT OUR JOBS?  CREATING SHARED CONTEXT   HOW     Community At Work  © 2007    230   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    Thinking into the future is one of the hardest challenges for any group.   We don’t have good points of reference to distinguish between a large- scale goal and a small-scale goal.  Yet every complex project contains  many levels of goals-within-goals. For example,  consider the project of rebuilding an impoverished  neighborhood.  Suppose the overall large-scale goal were to restore the  vitality and economic viability of that neighborhood.  That goal would  no doubt contain many stages and milestones (such as attracting new  business to the area).  Furthermore, each stage would contain various  steps that must be taken before the milestone could be achieved.  Since we lack good points of reference to make the distinctions described  above, most groups find it difficult to engage in a planning process that  requires them to set overall goals and define stages and milestones.  WHY  1.  Hang a long sheet of paper across the front of the room.  At the  far right-hand end of the paper, write the group’s goal – for  example, “Goal:  Open a new office in Denver.” 2.  Ask the group to generate three to five milestones that must be  completed in order to reach the goal – for example, “Complete  our financial projections.” 3.  Write the milestones from left to right across the long sheet of  paper.  Leave as much space as possible between milestones. 4.  Break into small groups, and assign one milestone to each group.   Each group now identifies and lists each step it would take to  complete that milestone, and writes each step on a sticky note. 5.  Have everyone come up to the front and put his or her sticky  notes up on the wall, each step in sequence, leading up to their  milestone.  At the same time, people can review each other’s  work and add any steps that may be missing.  HOW  DEFINING GOALS AND MILESTONES  CREATING SHARED CONTEXT    Community At Work  © 2007     231     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  Tangents are a major cause of the frustration and confusion of the Groan  Zone.  When someone raises an issue that seems peripheral to the  discussion, other participants often become nervous.  They don’t want  the speaker to derail the conversation and take the group off track.  But  the speaker may believe that s/he has identified a crucial “side problem”  that the group must face before the “main problem” can be resolved. This dilemma comes up regularly.  Because everyone has a unique  perspective, it’s not unusual for one person to spot a hidden problem  that no one else has noticed.  Group members may think that the speaker  is wasting their time on a tangent, when in fact the speaker might be  ahead of the group in articulating hidden complexities.  And when that  happens, the group is plunged into the Groan Zone. Taking Tangents Seriously helps overcome mutual misunderstanding  because it supports the group to gain a deeper appreciation of each  person’s perspective. TAKING TANGENTS SERIOUSLY  WHY   HOW   CREATING SHARED CONTEXT  1.  At the beginning of a discussion, or when the first tangential issue  arises, post a blank sheet and title it “Side Issues.”  Add to it as  tangents are identified. 2.  At every meeting, ask the group to choose one topic from the list and  discuss it for 15 minutes. 3.  After 15 minutes ask, “Are we done, or would you prefer to extend the  time?” 4.  When time is up, finish with a quick summary.  Ask, “What have you  learned?  Are there any next steps you should take?”   5.  Repeat Steps 2 to 4 at subsequent meetings.    Community At Work  © 2007    232   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    STRENGTHENING RELATIONSHIPS GROAN ZONE THINKING ACTIVITY:  TYPE 2 People who know one another are more likely to overcome their differences  and find common ground than people who remain personally isolated from  one another.  This principle is noticeable in business and in politics, where  leaders often make a practice of building friendly relationships with their  colleagues and the families of their colleagues.  It holds true for grassroots  movements, where activists – progressives and conservatives alike –   intentionally design events to provide participants with a mixture of  community building and social action.  Yet this principle is undervalued in  the realm of group decision-making.  Bringing photographs of one’s family  members to a meeting, for example, or taking time to tell each other a little  about the neighborhood where one grew up – these activities are hard for  some people to imagine in the context of group decision-making. The facilitator’s task is to seek opportunities to strengthen relationships, in  order to counterbalance the struggles that make the Groan Zone so painful.   Participants need relief, even if temporary, from long, frustrating meetings.   More important, broadening the context of working relationships allows  people to see one another as real people, not just as “opponents” or “allies.”   Relationship building strengthens the foundation of mutual understanding. NEW TOPIC DECISION POINT ? Strengthening Relationships   Community At Work  © 2007     233     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  This activity is a variation of “Two Truths and a Lie”  presented by Bill Schmidt, instructor in  Organizational Psychology at the Wright Institute,  Berkeley, California, 1993.   ANECDOTES & MEMENTOS    TWO TRUTHS AND A LIE    THE SUPPORT SEAT  1. Ask everyone to come to the next meeting  prepared to share something personal – a  memento, a photograph, or an anecdote. 2. At the next meeting, ask for volunteers to  share their memorabilia with the group.   3. Before starting, establish an order for the  presentations.  Also, clarify what will  happen if the group runs out of time.     For example, “We only have thirty minutes  for this today.  If we don’t finish, we’ll do  the remaining people next time.” 4. Give each presenter five minutes to speak.   Allow time for two or three questions. 1. Describe the activity.*  Explain that all  members will tell the group three things  about themselves:  two truths and a lie.   The lie must be a bald-faced lie, not a half- truth.  For example, someone who has one  brother may not say, “I have two brothers.”   S/he could say, “I have twelve brothers.” 2. After all have told their tales, have everyone  quickly raise hands to indicate which “fact”  they think was the lie.  Ask, “How many  people think the lie was such-and-such?” 3. Have the person reveal the lie.  Then call on  the next person to take a turn. 4. After everyone has gone, applaud those  who did the best job of fooling the group. 1. Arrange the chairs in a semi-circle, and    put one chair in front, facing the rest. 2. Describe the activity.  Explain that each  person will sit in the support seat for 20  minutes, while everyone else asks that  person about his or her life away from  work.  Members may ask whatever they  wish.  The person in the center can always  say, “I prefer not to answer that question.” 3. Ask for someone to sit in the support seat. 4. Anyone can ask the first question.  S/he  may ask one follow-up question, but must  then pass until everyone has had a turn.   Note:  This activity is often spread over  several meetings. GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER  STRENGTHENING RELATIONSHIPS  *    Community At Work  © 2007    234   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    GIVING AND RECEIVING FEEDBACK  STRENGTHENING RELATIONSHIPS  1. Ask everyone to find a partner. 2. Allow each person five minutes to give    his or her partner feedback as follows:   First:  “Something I observe about you is…”   Then:  “What I make up in my head about   this observation is…” 3. When five minutes have passed, remind  each pair to switch roles.  The speaker  becomes the listener, and vice versa.   4.  Optional:  When time is up, ask everyone  to find a different partner.  Repeat Steps 2  and 3 with the new partner. 5. Debrief in large group. OBSERVATIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS 1. Count the number of group members and  subtract one.  Then distribute that many  sheets of blank pages to each participant.   For example, each person in an eight- person group would receive seven sheets. 2. Ask everyone to write one thing they  appreciate about each group member.  This  can be something simple, or something  more personal and thoughtful. 3. When everyone has written one message to  each member, ask everyone to fold their  messages, stand up, and put each note on  its proper chair. 4. When all messages have been delivered,  have people return to their seats and read. 5. Debrief, allowing at least fifteen minutes. APPRECIATIONS  1. Describe the activity.  Explain that one  person will ask the group, “How do I come  across in our meetings?  What are my  strengths and weaknesses?”  People can  respond with statements like, “I see you  protecting Jim when he misses a deadline.”   Or, “You’re the only person who really  listens to everyone’s opinions.” 2. Ask for a volunteer.  Set a firm time limit  for this person to hear how s/he comes  across.  Allow at least 15 minutes.   3. While people state their perceptions, make  sure the recipient listens without speaking.   When time is up, give him or her at least 5  minutes to respond. 4. Move to another volunteer.  If members  prefer to continue interacting with the first  person, set another limit.  HOW DO I COME ACROSS?  * *  Source:  Nancy Feinstein, Ph.D. organization  development specialist, as told to Sam Kaner,  May 1995.   Community At Work  © 2007     235     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  BUILDING A SHARED FRAMEWORK OF UNDERSTANDING Structured activities like those presented in this chapter are very helpful  during periods of misunderstanding.  They help people focus on the same  thing at the same time.  But it’s not easy for a facilitator to obtain a group’s  agreement to do a structured activity.  People oppose facilitators regularly –  and this is particularly true in the Groan Zone, when the trust levels are low  and the tension levels are high.  Thus, someone may oppose a suggestion  because s/he imagines it was proposed as a direct, personal response to  something s/he said.  Someone else may interpret a facilitator’s suggestion as  a power play.  Others may feel that the proposed activity would slow the  pace of discussion or move the group in the wrong direction.  For all these  reasons and more, facilitators must expect the group to challenge, and  probably reject, a high percentage of such suggestions.   When this happens, remember to honor objections and ask for suggestions. In the Groan Zone, everyone’s ideas are frequently misunderstood – and  yours will be too.  Keep in mind that your role is to help, not to be “right.”    Be patient, be tolerant, be flexible; don’t be attached to what you suggest.   Here’s the general rule:  in the Groan Zone people are under pressure – they  need the facilitator’s support. NEW TOPIC DECISION POINT ?

ATTEMPTED DECISION Groan Zone Business as Usual Closure Zone Divergent Zone In the Convergent Zone, the facilitator’s main task is to help the group  develop inclusive alternatives and synthesize them into a solution that will  work for everyone.  This is often easier than it sounds.  Once a group has  managed to build a shared framework of understanding, the discussion can  move pretty quickly, and quite comfortably, with little intervention.   There are many exceptions, however.  Some groups have trouble thinking  creatively.  They need help breaking out of their habitual mental categories.  To spur their imagination, a facilitator may wish to provide them with case  studies of inclusive solutions like the ones presented in this chapter.  The  power of discussing a real-life example is that it can stimulate insights that  may apply to the group’s current situation. There are other groups that become almost intoxicated with the excitement  of fast-paced thinking.  They are prone to make hasty decisions that are  destined to become underfunded and overcommitted.  Those groups need a   facilitator’s help to be rigorous, not impulsive, as they fine-tune their  thinking and strengthen the logic and the quality of their ideas.    Community At Work  © 2007     239     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  DEVELOPING INCLUSIVE SOLUTIONS A group enters the Convergent Zone when it has developed a shared  framework of understanding.  Its discussion then becomes much easier.   Here’s a sample of what happens.  First someone offers an interesting idea,  and others try it on for size.  Someone else adds to it or blends it with a  completely different idea.  People are able to say to themselves, “I know why  so-and-so would not like that idea; I wonder if I can think of a way to meet  that need.”  The whole group is operating within a shared context of  meaning.  When this happens – when the members of a group can  realistically include one another’s perspectives in their own thinking – they  are on their way to finding a solution that will incorporate everyone’s needs  and goals.  This is the work of the Convergent Zone. Three types of convergent thinking are discussed in this chapter:  Applying  Inclusive Principles, Creative Reframing, and Strengthening Good Ideas. Type 1:  Applying Inclusive Principles Applying Inclusive Principles entails identifying and discussing principles that  promote creative problem solving.  A group can use these principles to  develop a solution that works for everyone.  A fine way to develop a  both/and mind-set is to study case examples and discuss their relevance to  the situation at hand.  The essence of this type of thinking is application.  Type 2:  Creative Reframing Creative Reframing involves altering one’s beliefs about the nature of the  problem at hand.  Members identify core assumptions and deliberately  replace or reverse them in order to gain an alternative  perspective.  The goal  is to acquire a “breakthrough experience,” a significant change in outlook.   The essence of this type of thinking is paradigm shifting.  Type 3:  Strengthening Good Ideas Strengthening Good Ideas refers to the group’s efforts to evaluate and refine  the logic and quality of their thinking.  The process is iterative.  Every new  insight causes the basic idea to strengthen and grow.  The essence of this  type of thinking is critical reasoning.  THREE TYPES OF THINKING IN THE CONVERGENT ZONE    Community At Work  © 2007    240   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    APPLYING INCLUSIVE PRINCIPLES CONVERGENT ZONE THINKING ACTIVITY:  TYPE 1 DECISION POINT NEW TOPIC ? Applying  Inclusive Principles Inclusive, nonadversarial, problem-solving principles, like those listed on  the next page, are often at the heart of sustainable agreements.  For  example, consider the previously discussed case of the Mendocino County  timber tax committee.  After years of disagreement over the rate of logging,  they found an inclusive solution when they realized that a change in the tax  code would benefit everyone.  Thus, they switched from taxing standing  trees, a method used for forty years, to taxing cut trees.  Underlying this  change was a creative problem-solving principle:  challenge fixed assumptions  – just because something has always been done one way doesn’t mean it has to be  done that way in the future.   A facilitator can encourage group members to identify and discuss inclusive  principles that might apply to their current situation.  This will foster  creative thinking.  For example, you might show a group the Mendocino  case, discuss it, and then ask, “What are our group’s fixed assumptions?  Are  there any we can challenge?”  As this example shows, real-life cases are an  excellent vehicle for helping groups explore inclusive principles.  Several  more case studies are presented in the following pages.    Community At Work  © 2007     241     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  These problem-solving principles help people synthesize seemingly opposing  alternatives into an integrated solution.  Note that none of these requires  group members to use adversarial methods to resolve their differences.  They  all lead to solutions that work for everyone.  Create more  interdependence  between the alternatives  (e.g., “you cut and I choose”). Back up from solutions  to needs.  Then search  for a solution that meets  everyone’s needs. Find out how  others have solved  a similar problem. Search for  resources from  unusual sources. Challenge fixed  assumptions:  just because  something has always been  done one way, doesn’t  mean it has to be done that  way in the future. HOW CAN WE  DO BOTH? Search for  underlying  shared goals. Do joint ventures  with new partners. Negotiate for  more time. Self-selection:   let everyone do  what they want! Divide the problem  into independent  parts and solve  each separately. Question anything  that seems  impossible.    Community At Work  © 2007    242  FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    1. Photocopy and distribute some or all of the following case studies.  2. Ask everyone to read one or two cases. 3.  Have everyone find a partner and discuss their case studies.  Ask,    “What reactions are you having to what you just read?”   4.  After five minutes, reconvene the large group and ask, “Has anyone  found a principle that might shed new light on our situation?”     Allow ample time for discussion.  WHY   HOW   APPLYING INCLUSIVE PRINCIPLES  USING CASE STUDIES The next six pages present capsule summaries of inclusive solutions to  difficult real-life problems.  Each case demonstrates the use of an inclusive  principle – that is, a problem-solving principle that enables participants to  develop a creative solution that takes everyone’s interests into account. Left to their own inclinations, few groups make the effort to keep looking  for fresh ideas.  Thus, the facilitator has a key role in motivating people  to search for inclusive solutions.  But this creates a challenge.  Some   facilitators offer their groups potential solutions, but many groups don’t  respond well to facilitators who attempt to “join the group.”  There is a  surprisingly high likelihood that a group will reject a facilitator’s solution  without even considering its merits.   Fortunately, there are alternatives.  One particularly useful method is to  present real-life examples of inclusive solutions to difficult problems, and  encourage discussion.  For many people, discussing a case study is more  effective than listening to a lecture.  This approach preserves the  facilitator’s neutrality even as it inspires group members to keep working  toward sustainable agreements.  Accordingly, the following examples  have been designed to be used as tools that can stimulate discussion.    Community At Work  © 2007     243     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  CASE STUDY: BREAKING WITH TRADITION Source:  San Jose Mercury News, March 6, 1994. SOLUTION Mothers were allowed to bring  their infants to the office and  keep them by their desks.  They   stayed at work the whole day and  tended to their infants’ needs as  necessary.  Their pay was slightly  reduced to reflect the actual hours  they worked.  When the infants  became toddlers, they were placed  at a nearby day care center  sponsored by the bank. PROBLEM At San Jose National Bank, many of the  employees were women.  One year, 10  percent of the staff became pregnant.  A  high rate of maternity leave would  clearly cause a serious drop in  productivity.  Management pondered the  options.  Should maternity leave be  limited?  Should some of the employees  be laid off?  The expectant mothers  recognized that the bank could suffer,  but they also felt it was important to be  with their babies during their first  months of life.  Each group understood  the other’s point of view, but no one felt able to change positions. PRINCIPLE The solution to this problem was to  break with the tradition that parents  must choose between working and  being with their children.  Here, the  bank’s needs (getting the work done)  and the mothers’ needs (staying with  their infants) were combined.  In  your situation, is there a tradition  that locks you into an either / or  position?  Why is that tradition seen  as “sacred”?  If it were challenged,  what new options might open up? APPLYING INCLUSIVE PRINCIPLES     Community At Work  © 2007    244   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    CASE STUDY: YOU CUT AND I CHOOSE Source:  R. Fisher and W. Ury, Getting to Yes (New York: Penguin Books, 1983), p. 58.  Representatives from many nations met  to develop international policies  regarding the mining of oceanic  resources.  One problem they addressed  was how to best allocate underwater  mining sites.  The Enterprise, a U.N.  organization representing poorer  countries, charged that rich countries  had an unfair advantage.  They feared  that private companies from wealthy  countries could identify the superior  mining sites because they had better  radar and mining equipment and  superior expertise.  With this  knowledge, the rich countries could  propose an unequal allocation of  mining resources, and the poorer  countries would have no way to  evaluate the fairness of the allocation. PROBLEM The representatives decided to ask a  private company to identify two  mining sites of equal value, using its  sophisticated equipment and expertise.   The Enterprise would then choose one  of the sites for the poorer countries to  mine.  The private company would get  the other one.  In this way, the private  companies would have an incentive to  identify two sites of equal value, thus  giving poorer nations the benefit of  their expertise.  SOLUTION This situation involved competition  for a fixed resource:  high-quality  mining sites.  The inclusive  principle they employed was to tie  the interests of the more powerful  party to those of the less powerful  party.  In your own situation, what  incentives might induce the more  powerful party to participate? PRINCIPLE  APPLYING INCLUSIVE PRINCIPLES     Community At Work  © 2007     245     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  CASE STUDY: DISCOVERING COMMON GROUND Source:  B. Gray, Collaborating (San Francisco:  Jossey-Bass, 1989), p. 95. SOLUTION At first the two sides locked horns and  argued over who was to blame for the  disinvestment.  Their breakthrough  came when they realized they all shared  a common concern:  preserving the  neighborhood.  Together they founded  a local development corporation that  promoted commercial revitalization,  and they created a foreclosure  rehabilitation program for which the  lenders raised funds. PROBLEM A suburb of a large city was becoming  more and more racially diverse.   Residents formed a community council  to preserve the neighborhood’s character  while simultaneously promoting racial  integration.  The council suspected that  financial institutions were cutting back  on their investment in the neighborhood  because of the demographic changes.   After investigating several local lending  institutions, the council found evidence  that lenders were indeed using  discriminatory tactics.  The council  demanded more investment in its  neighborhood, and it threatened to  boycott the lenders.  The lenders denied  the charges and refused to cooperate with  further monitoring. PRINCIPLE Affixing blame, polarizing into  opposing camps, and calling for help  from the powers-that-be is a typical   strategy for dealing with the problems  created by changing circumstances.    In this case, participants followed a  different principle.  They focused on  discovering shared concerns, and they  aimed at developing a shared vision.   This helped them collaborate  effectively and take constructive,  self-empowered action.  APPLYING INCLUSIVE PRINCIPLES     Community At Work  © 2007    246   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    CASE STUDY:  INCLUDING THE  “TROUBLEMAKERS” IN THE SOLUTION Source:  Marshall Rosenberg’s workshop on Compassionate Communication, February 1995,  as related by Liz Dittrich to Sam Kaner’s Group Facilitation Skills class, June 1995. SOLUTION Neighborhood residents met and  discussed ideas for solving this  problem.  They decided that a  midnight basketball program would  provide the youths with an alternative  to hanging out and getting in trouble.   The community members saw this as  a way to improve neighborhood  safety without requiring outside  intervention.  The  city administrators  were pleased because the program  would help keep youth off the streets  at night. PROBLEM A community had a problem with its  high school youth, whose public  behavior was becoming increasingly  unruly, especially at night.  The city  administration decided to increase  police patrols and impose a curfew for  the youth in the neighborhood.    Community members rejected this  decision.  They felt that the curfew  would restrict everyone’s freedom,  and the increased police presence  would probably increase violence in  the neighborhood.   PRINCIPLE Normally we try to “fix” the people  who make trouble – whether by  incarcerating them, hospitalizing  them, expelling them, going to war  with them, or controlling their  behavior.  By contrast, it sometimes  can be advantageous to treat the  troublemakers as stakeholders, and  involve them in the problem-solving  process.  If their needs can be  understood, they might become  allies in transforming the problem.  APPLYING INCLUSIVE PRINCIPLES     Community At Work  © 2007     247     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  CASE STUDY: UNUSUAL PARTNERSHIP Source:  M. Doyle and D. Straus, How to Make Meetings Work (New York: Jove Press, 1982), p. 56.  A small western city had a one-time- only budget surplus.  Two groups  immediately began vying for the  funds.  On one side, a coalition of  women’s groups wished to use the  money to expand the city’s  inadequate day care facilities.  On  the other side, homeowners and the  city’s firefighters wanted to upgrade  their antiquated firefighting  equipment to protect homes and  lower insurance costs. PROBLEM A small portion of the money was  used to convert the city’s old fire  stations into day care centers.  The  new centers were used to attract state  and federal matching funds to  operate them.  The majority of the  money was then used to build three  new fire stations.  The new stations  raised the city’s fire rating from AA to  AAA, thus lowering insurance rates  and raising property values – which  in turn enabled new equipment  purchases. SOLUTION Competing for funding is the  normal way to proceed when  finances are limited.  Yet the groups  in this case partnered in order to  identify additional resources from  sources that were foreign to their  own contexts.   Can your group partner with its  competitors?  Are there other  unusual alliances to explore? PRINCIPLE  APPLYING INCLUSIVE PRINCIPLES     Community At Work  © 2007    248   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    CASE STUDY:  LOCATING RESOURCES TO SUPPORT LONG-TERM STABILITY Source:  Told to Sarah Fisk by John Seed, environmentalist and author. SOLUTION Environmentalists helped the  indigenous people start their own  lumber company with a small,  portable sawmill that could process  trees one at a time.  The cut lumber  was worth significantly more than  the company had offered for the  trees, so the people did not feel  pressured to log more than was  appropriate for the health of the  forest.  The logging company  purchased the lumber, which it  then resold at a profit overseas. PROBLEM In a rainforest in New Guinea, the  indigenous people were approached  by a large lumber corporation.  The  company offered to pay a lump sum  for the right to clear-cut the forest and  extract the hardwood trees.  The deal  sounded fantastic to many members  of the impoverished forest tribe; they  wanted to sell their only marketable  commodity in exchange for money,  which they could use to buy things  they could not produce themselves.   Local environmentalists, however,  were alarmed; the forests would be  completely and irreplaceably  destroyed. PRINCIPLE Group problem-solving often seeks  simple, direct solutions that focus on  the near term, and the immediate need.   But it sometimes makes more sense to  search for solutions that take a longer  view.  As this case example illustrates, a  consideration of long-term  sustainability can lead to the  emergence of creative strategies that  would not have been entertained in a  search for a quick fix. APPLYING INCLUSIVE PRINCIPLES     Community At Work  © 2007     249     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  CREATIVE REFRAMING CONVERGENT ZONE THINKING ACTIVITY:  TYPE 2 Creative Reframing involves breaking out of our normal categories of analysis  and reexamining our beliefs and assumptions.  This type of thinking  requires us to make a deliberate mental shift in order to look at a problem  from a completely different angle.  Making such a shift can lead a group to  see choices to which they were blind just moments before.  Because it is counterintuitive and “unnatural,” creative reframing is a type of  thinking that rarely happens spontaneously.  A facilitator can guide a group  toward this type of thinking in two ways – either with structured thinking  activities or through informal technique that helps participants shift their  thinking.  As an example of the latter, one could ask questions like, “Is that  the only way to do this?” or “Suppose this had never happened.  Would  that change your choice of action?”  Simple questions like these can be  posed with relatively little forethought.  Alternatively, one can use the  activities provided on the following pages. NEW TOPIC DECISION POINT ? Creative Reframing    Community At Work  © 2007    250   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    It’s a problem. It’s an opportunity. It’s them. It’s all of us. PERCEIVED PROBLEM REFRAMED PROBLEM We need to gather more input. We need to pay more attention to the input we’re already getting. Our employees are incompetent. Our employees don’t have enough  time to do a quality job. We can’t get along with  each other. We haven’t made the commitment  to work through our feelings  toward one another. We don’t have any power  in this system. We haven’t found our leverage  points in this system. We don’t have enough money. We haven’t figured out how to find  new sources of money. We don’t have enough resources. We are wasting the resources we  do have. Our goal is unachievable. We don’t have our goal broken  into realistic steps. Our product won’t sell. We’re trying to sell our product  to the wrong people. We don’t have enough time  to do all of these things. We have to decide what to do now  and what to do later. TWO WAYS OF LOOKING AT THE SAME PROBLEM    Community At Work  © 2007     251     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING   WHY   CREATIVE REFRAMING  INTRODUCING REFRAMING TO A GROUP Once someone perceives a problem in a particular way, s/he may find it  difficult to see that problem in any other way.  Our minds tend to lock  into a pattern of thought.  For example, many job recruiters routinely   decline to hire a talented applicant because of the applicant’s appearance;  yet in some companies, this habit persists even when recruiting for  technical positions, when appearance has no impact on performance. When tackling difficult problems, most people reach conclusions quickly.   They believe they have explored every option for a solution and that it  would be pointless to waste more time.  The idea that it might be possible  to reframe a problem – that is, to dramatically alter their understanding  of the nature of the problem – is, for most people, a paradigm shift.  Thus, facilitators who decide to encourage their groups to undertake   creative reframing often find it quite challenging to motivate people to  invest the time.  This tool is designed to help facilitators overcome that  initial wall of resistance.    HOW  1. Hand out copies of page 250, Two Ways of Looking at the Same Problem. 2. Ask people to discuss the differences between a perceived problem and a  reframed problem.  Remember that many people will be thinking about  this concept for the first time ever; as part of digesting a new idea, they  may say things that sound rigid or naive.  Expect remarks like, “As far as  I'm concerned, this whole idea is ridiculous.”  Remember to honor all  points of view and remain supportive throughout the discussion. 3. After several minutes say, “Now let’s apply this theory to our own  situation.  Could someone please state our perceived problem?”  Write  the perceived problem on a flipchart.  Then ask the group to brainstorm  a list of reframes of the problem.  Record all answers on flipcharts. 4. After the brainstorm, encourage members to discuss the implications of  their new ideas.  Say, “As you review this list, what are your reactions?”    Community At Work  © 2007    252   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    Habits of thought are as hard to break as habits of any other kind.   Suppose, for example, that someone thinks his or her boss is afraid of  confrontation.  That person may find it very difficult to change this  opinion, even if the boss has actually changed. Entire groups fall into these habits of thought, too.  For example, a  management team had to refill a specific staff position five times in less  than a year.  Yet every time they lost another person, the managers  simply recruited someone else for the job and crossed their fingers.  Not  until the end of the year did they consider reorganizing the department  and doing away with that job altogether. What’s Unchangeable About This Problem allows a group to explore hidden  assumptions and biases in the way they have defined a problem.  Once a  group has identified a self-limiting assumption, they often discover a new  line of thought that leads to a creative, innovative solution. 1.  At the top of a flipchart, write “What’s unchangeable about our  problem?” 2.  List everyone’s answers. 3.  Ask the group to look over the list and identify any hidden  assumptions and biases.  Encourage open discussion. 4.  Based on these insights, list any aspects of the problem that may be  changeable after all.  WHY   HOW  WHAT’S UNCHANGEABLE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM?  CREATIVE REFRAMING     Community At Work  © 2007     253     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  Everyone makes assumptions.  People often take it for granted that  everyone else is making the same assumptions about such things as the  meanings of words, the likelihood that an event will occur, and the  motives behind a person’s actions – to name just a few.  When members  are unaware of differences in their assumptions, they may find it very  difficult to understand each other’s thinking and behavior.   For example, the director of a city agency asked her staff for input on a  proposed reorganization.  A few people took her request seriously, but  many others treated it lightly.  This caused turmoil at staff meetings until  the explanation was found.  Several people had heard a rumor that the  director was leaving; they doubted the reorganization would ever occur.   The few who worked hard to give input were those who had not heard  the rumor.  These differences in assumptions were never mentioned, but  they influenced everyone’s commitment to the task. Key Words helps people explore the meaning of the statements they make  to one another.  By discussing the meanings of key words, people can  identify unspoken assumptions that are causing miscommunication.  WHY  KEY WORDS  CREATIVE REFRAMING   HOW  1.  Have the group compose a problem statement.  For example, “New  computers are too expensive to purchase.”  Write it on a flipchart.  2.  Ask group members to identify the key words in the statement.   Underline all key words.  For example, “New computers are too  expensive to purchase.” 3.  Have the group identify which word to focus on first.  Then ask,  “What questions does this word raise?”  Record all responses.  Then  ask, “Does this word suggest any assumptions that can be challenged?   For example, is ‘purchase’ the only way to obtain new computers?” 4.  Repeat Step 3 for each key word.  Note:  Encourage discussion  throughout this activity.  This tool was inspired by an exercise called “Lasso” in M. Doyle and D. Straus, How to Make  Meetings Work (New York:  Jove Books, 1982).    Community At Work  © 2007    254   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    TWO REFRAMING ACTIVITIES CREATIVE REFRAMING 1.  Hang a sheet of chart paper titled,   “Assumptions About This Problem.” 2. Have the group list assumptions about  • The causes of the problem • The connections between different  aspects of the problem. 3. Ask someone to select an item from  the list, and reverse it.  For example,  consider an item like “We are losing  our best employees.” Reverse this to,  “We’re keeping our best employees.” 4. Ask, “How could we bring about this  new, opposite state of affairs?”   Encourage a brainstorm of answers.  5. Choose another assumption and  repeat Steps 3 and 4.  When done,   discuss ideas that seem promising. REVERSING ASSUMPTIONS  A version of this activity appears in M. Michalko,  ThinkerToys (Berkeley, CA: Ten Speed Press, 1992), p. 45. REMOVING CONSTRAINTS 1.  Have the group generate constraints  by asking, “What is keeping us from  developing the best solution to this  problem?” 2. Upon completing the list, consider  each item one at a time, asking,  “What if this were not a problem?”  For example, “What if we had plenty  of funds available?  How would we  solve our problem in that case?” 3. Keep each discussion brief for now.   The goal is to scan the list in search  of promising options.   4. When finished with the first pass,  have the group identify potential  high-payoff ideas in preparation for  extended discussion.    Community At Work  © 2007     255     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  TWO MORE REFRAMING ACTIVITIES  CREATIVE REFRAMING  1.  Ask the group to break the problem  into its major components.  For  example, consider the problem of  keeping public libraries open.  This  might divide into such components  as “funding,” “usage,” “staffing,”   “civic priorities,” and so on. 2. Ask a volunteer to select any   component.  For example, suppose   someone picks “staffing.”  3. Treat that selection as the central  cause of the problem.  Ask, “How  might this affect our view of the  problem?”  For example, suppose  “staffing” is viewed as the central  cause of the problem.  Someone  might now suggest a new approach  to the problem:  perhaps volunteers  could help staff the library during  busy hours, enabling the library to  remain open with less funding. RECENTERING THE CAUSE CATASTROPHIZING   (WE’RE DOOMED NO MATTER WHAT WE DO) 1.  Ask everyone to think about the  problem from their own perspective,  imagining anything and everything  that could go wrong.   2. Have each person in turn state his or  her worst-case scenario. 3. Encourage each new speaker to build  on the previous ideas until the  situation seems doomed.  Whining  and complaining are an integral part  of the activity at this point. 4. When the humor has subsided, have  the group identify obstacles that  merit further discussion.   5.  Go down the list of obstacles one at a  time, asking “Is this one capable of  producing a catastrophe?”  If so, ask,  “What could be done to reduce its  potential impact?”      Community At Work  © 2007    256   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    STRENGTHENING GOOD IDEAS CONVERGENT ZONE THINKING ACTIVITY:  TYPE 3 Strengthening Good Ideas is a type of thinking that encompasses such  questions as, “What resources will we need to make this work?  Do we have  them?” and “Who else should take a look at this idea?  What would they  say?” and “If we actually decide to move forward, who will do what by  when?”  During this period of critical thinking, the facilitator’s job is to help  group members analyze potential problems with their game plan.  Are there  flaws in the reasoning?  Are there other options that have not been  adequately explored?  Does the idea really meet the group’s stated criteria  for success?  The more questions like these a group can discuss, the better  will be the quality of the group’s eventual decisions.  And that translates  into sustainability.  As a rule, groups who have built a shared framework of understanding can  evaluate and refine their ideas without formal structure – and without much  facilitation, either.  But occasionally – especially when the stakes are high –  a facilitator will want to ensure the caliber of the work by offering a  structured thinking activity, such as those provided in the following pages. NEW TOPIC DECISION POINT ? Strengthening Good Ideas    Community At Work  © 2007     257     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  CLARIFYING EVALUATION CRITERIA  STRENGTHENING GOOD IDEAS  1.  Have the group brainstorm a list of answers to this question:  “By  doing this project (or solving this problem, or developing this plan,   for example), what are we trying to accomplish?” 2. Start a new chart titled “Selection Criteria.”  Facilitate the group to  reword the items on the first list so that each item is now a statement  of a possible selection criterion.  For example, if an item from the  brainstorm list is, “We’re trying to get two opposing factions to work  together,” the rewording might be, “It allows both factions to work  together.”  Another rewording might be, “It appeals to both factions.” 3. Explain that the list will soon be reduced to no more than five items.   To prepare members for that judgment, have people break into small  groups and discuss which criteria seem most important, and why. 4. Reconvene the large group.  Have people select items from the list of  criteria, and ask them to advocate for retaining those items on a final  list of five or fewer criteria. 5. Give everyone five votes.  Tally the results, and eliminate all but the  top five vote-getters.  This may not be a final decision on criteria.  It  will provide the membership with a sense of what people value most. How should a group choose one proposal over another?  One way is to  agree on the criteria to use in evaluating each proposal.  For example,  suppose a group agreed that its most important criteria were “easy to do”  and “inexpensive.”  These criteria could help them reject a proposal that  would be expensive or difficult, even if the project seemed interesting. This activity helps group members to discuss and reach agreement on a  list of five or fewer criteria, by defining criteria before specific proposals  are brought up for consideration.  WHY   HOW     Community At Work  © 2007    258   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    This activity improves the viability of a proposal by reducing the costs  and risks that are associated with it. For example, the mayor of a large city recently received several million  dollars to improve public transportation.  The public favored a proposal  to spend the money on new bus routes.  But the mayor was committed to  upholding a previously announced hiring freeze:  no new city employees  were to be hired until the budget was balanced.  On one hand, without  new bus drivers, no more routes could be added.  On the other hand, if  new bus drivers were hired, the other government agencies would lobby  for exemptions for their programs. Payoffs And Risks helped the mayor’s planning staff explore in detail the  risks they would face if they went ahead with a route expansion.   Through the analysis, they discovered a way to reduce their risk.  They  enlisted the local newspapers in an editorial campaign to build political  support for this exception to the hiring freeze.  It was successful, and they  were able to add three new bus routes without opposition. 1.  Hang three sheets of flipchart paper.  Title the first page “Payoffs” and  the second page “Risks.”  Leave the third page untitled. 2.  On page one, list the payoffs associated with the proposal. 3.  On page two, list the risks associated with the same proposal. 4.  Now title page three “Ways to Reduce Risk.” For each risk listed on the  “Risks” page, discuss options for reducing the costs and the extent of  the risk.  Record the discussion on page three. 5.  After the costs are more fully understood, ask for new proposals that  preserve the payoffs while incorporating some of the risk-reducing  options.  WHY   HOW  PAYOFFS AND RISKS  STRENGTHENING GOOD IDEAS     Community At Work  © 2007     259     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  1. Ask the group to list the major tasks that must be achieved if the  proposal under consideration is to be implemented.   2. Assign two or three people to think about each task.  Have them  choose a record keeper and a spokesperson. 3. Give the small groups the following instruction:  “For the next 10  minutes, think about the steps necessary to complete your assigned  task.  Break the task into small, doable action steps.” 4. When time is up, reconvene the large group and ask the spokesperson  from each group to report on his or her group’s work. 5. After all committees have reported, ask everyone to discuss whether   the overall proposal is adequate or requires modification. Sometimes groups agree to proposals that sound wonderful but have not  been thought through very well.  This is usually not a problem, because  most such agreements pertain to matters of small importance.  But  occasionally, a group will agree to a huge undertaking with absolutely no  sense of what they’re in for. For example, a group of eight nurses once agreed to organize a large  conference that would bring together representatives from more than  one hundred agencies in Los Angeles.  The purpose of the conference was  to build a coalition that could influence state and county funding  policies.  The organizers did not have the slightest grasp of the effort it  would take them, yet they publicized the conference and kept taking on  new responsibilities as they came up.  Eventually one person lost her job,  and another got very sick.  The conference itself was disorganized, poorly  attended and, ultimately, insignificant.  In retrospect the nurses said,  “We should have been more realistic to begin with.”  WHY   HOW  RESOURCE ANALYSIS: CAN WE REALLY MAKE THIS WORK?  STRENGTHENING GOOD IDEAS     Community At Work  © 2007    260   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    1.  Have group members generate lists of people who:       •  Will be directly affected by this decision.     •  Have final sign-off authority.     •  Have to implement the decision.     •  Could sabotage the process. 2.  Take a few moments to examine the list.  Discuss the following  questions:  “What’s the likelihood that any of these stakeholders  would disagree with our ultimate decision?  If any of them did not  support the decision, how might that affect our ability to implement?” 3.  Next consider each person or group on the list.  Who needs to be  consulted before the final decision is made? 4.  For each person or group who will be consulted, decide on the best  method for doing so.  Some methods for including other stakeholders  are interviews, focus groups, questionnaires, and an invitation to a  core group meeting. Most decisions do not just affect the people who make them.  Obviously,  not everyone who will be affected can participate in making a decision  and planning its implementation.  Nonetheless, it can be very, very  costly to overlook the perspectives of those who did not participate in  developing the reasoning that led to the decison. This activity helps a group to think proactively about the question, “Who  else needs to be consulted?”  It usually takes a group two or three hours –  sometimes longer – to go through all the steps.  Obviously this is a significant  investment of group time.  To decide whether to do this activity, ask,  “How much time will we lose if we don’t do this thinking?”  WHY   HOW  WHO ELSE NEEDS TO EVALUATE THIS PROPOSAL?  STRENGTHENING GOOD IDEAS     Community At Work  © 2007     261     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  1.  Draw a matrix with four vertical columns.  Title the columns:  “Tasks,”  “Who,” “By When,” and “Resources Needed.” 2.  Under the first heading, “Tasks,” list all tasks that need to be done.  If  additional tasks are identified later, add them to the list. 3.  Number each task listed.  Then discuss:  “Who will do this?  By when?   What resources are needed?”  Often this thinking is done in an open  discussion format, in which group members flip back and forth from  one question to another.   4.  As specific agreements are made, write them on the chart. Group decision-making is often viewed as an exercise in futility. In the  experience of many, agreements reached during meetings are likely to be  implemented poorly, if at all. The odds of successful implementation increase when a group takes the  time to spell out specifically what needs to be done, who will do it, by  when, and with what resources.  But often this step does not occur.   Instead, people act as if they assumed that once an agreement has been  reached, the follow-through will happen magically.  “Someone else” will  tend to the details later. When a group stays fuzzy about the specifics of implementing an  agreement, two or three people will probably wind up with all of the  tasks – often without adequate resources.  Alternatively, no one takes  responsibility, and nothing happens.  This activity supports group members to consider, in advance, the  resources needed to undertake these efforts and commit to well-defined  tasks by specific times.  Moreover, the responsibilities often are  distributed more evenly, because the issues are discussed openly when  everyone is listening.  WHY   HOW  WHO DOES WHAT BY WHEN?  STRENGTHENING GOOD IDEAS     Community At Work  © 2007    262   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING     TIME  Three common types of convergent thinking are shown above.  Each type  can be supported by activities like those presented in this chapter.  Some  activities help a group gain insight into the principles underlying inclusive  solutions.  Others enable a group to manipulate their assumptions in order  to break out of fixed positions.  Still others support participants to evaluate  and refine the quality and the logic of their thinking. Structured thinking activities are useful when a group appears to be trapped  in an either/or mentality.  Groups in this condition need inspiration and  stimulation.  Structured activities also support groups to do the nitty-gritty  work of making sure their ideas can be implemented.  But it would be  misleading to suggest that groups in the Convergent Zone spend much time  engaged in structured thinking.  The truth is the opposite.  Convergent Zone  discussions are largely self-managing.  For many facilitators, the hardest part  is learning to sit down and get out of the group’s way!    Sustainable agreements require well-thought-out ideas that incorporate  everyone’s needs and goals.  If the struggle of the Groan Zone is the heart of  a sustainable agreement, the ingenuity of the Convergent Zone is the brain.

During a discussion,  people think.  They discuss.  They consider their options.  During the  implementation, people act on what they’ve decided.  Thus, for example,  during a discussion, participants might figure out the budget for a project; in  the implementation of that project, people spend the money. During the discussion, in other words, a group operates in the world of ideas;  after the decision has been made, that group shifts into the world of action.   In the world of ideas, people explore possibilities; they develop models and  try them on in their imagination.  They hypothesize.  They extrapolate.   They evaluate alternatives and develop plans.  In the world of action, the  group has made a commitment to take an idea and make it come true.   Contracts are signed.  People are hired.  Departments are restructured, and  offices are relocated. The Decision Point is the point at which a decision is made.  It is the point that  separates thinking from action.  It is the point of authorization for the actions  that follow.  Discussion occurs before the point of decision; implementation  happens after the point of decision.   The Decision Point is the formal marker that says, “From this moment on, our  agreement will be treated as the officially authorized reality.  Disagreements  will no longer be treated as alternative points of view.  From now on,  objections are officially out of line.” DISCUSSION IMPLEMENTATION ✔ DECISION POINT DECISION RULES INTRODUCTION   Community At Work  © 2007     267     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  DECISION RULES THE CLASSIC  PROBLEM In practice, however, group members are often not sure whether a decision  has actually been made.   This can produce much confusion.  Someone who thinks a decision has been  made will feel empowered to take action in line with that decision.  But if  others think the decision has not yet been made, they will view the person  who took the action as “impulsive” or  “having their own agenda” or “not a  team player.”  In such cases, however, the person accused of acting  prematurely will frequently justify his or her action by saying, “I was sure we  decided to go ahead with that plan.” The same is true in reverse.  Inaction after the point of decision is often  perceived as “insubordinate” or “passive-aggressive” or “disloyal.”  In such  cases, it is common to hear people defend themselves by saying, “I don’t  recall us making an actual decision about that” or “I never agreed to this!”  These examples remind us that people need a clear, explicit indicator that a  decision has been made.  Some groups can clearly tell when a decision has or  has not been made.  For instance, groups that make decisions by majority  rule know they are still in the discussion phase until they vote and tally the  results.  But most groups are fuzzy about how they make decisions.  They lack  clear rules for bringing their discussion to closure. This chapter describes the six most common decision rules and explores the  implications of each one. DISCUSSION IMPLEMENTATION Some people are still  discussing; others  are implementing. ? ? ? ?    Community At Work  © 2007    268   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    Unanimous  Agreement Delegation “Flip a Coin” Person-in-Charge  Decides without Discussion Majority Vote Person-in-Charge  Decides after Discussion A decision rule is a mechanism that answers the question, “How do we know  when we’ve made a decision?”  Each of the six rules shown above performs  this basic function. COMMON DECISION RULES    Community At Work  © 2007     269     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  DECISION-MAKING WITHOUT A DECISION RULE Someone says, “Let’s put this on  next month’s agenda and pick up  where we left off.”  But at the next  meeting, the item is superseded by  urgent new business. Someone’s name gets vaguely  attached to a poorly defined task (as in, “Duane, why don’t you check  into that?”)  Later, that person gets  blamed for poor follow-through. The person-in-charge says, “Is everyone  okay with this idea?”  After a few seconds  of silence, the person-in-charge moves to  the next topic, believing that every  member’s silence meant “yes,” rather  than “no” or “I’m still thinking.” Those who whine or  raise their voice get  what they want. After the meeting ends  without agreement, a few  people meet behind closed  doors and make the real  decisions. When a quick decision has to be  made or an opportunity will be  lost, conservative members exercise  a pocket veto by stalling the  discussion.  Thus, “no decision”  becomes a decision not to act. The person who has the most at  stake makes an independent  decision; later, people resent him  or her for taking actions that did  not meet other people’s needs. The meeting goes overtime; the  discussion drags on and on. . . People assume that since  the issue was discussed, a  decision was made. Individual members act on their  own idiosyncratic perspectives.   Soon, the left hand doesn’t know  what the right hand is doing. Certain people always  get their way. Just as time runs out,  someone makes a new  suggestion.  This becomes  “the decision.”    Community At Work  © 2007    270   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    Low-Stakes Decisions With low-stakes issues, unanimous agreements are usually comparable in  quality to decisions reached by other decision rules.  Participants learn to  go along with proposals they can tolerate, rather than hold out for an  innovative solution that would take a lot of time and effort to develop. One benefit of using the unanimous agreement rule to make low-stakes  decisions is that it prevents a group from making a decision that is  abhorrent to a small minority.  Other decision rules can lead to outcomes  that are intolerable to one or two members, but are adopted because they  are popular with a majority.  By definition, such a decision will not be  made by unanimous agreement. UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT In groups that decide by unanimous agreement, members must keep working  to understand one another’s perspectives until they integrate those  perspectives into a shared framework of understanding.  Once people are  sufficiently familiar with each other’s views, they become capable of  advancing innovative proposals that are acceptable to everyone.  It takes a  lot of effort, but this is precisely why the unanimous agreement decision  rule has the best chance of producing sustainable agreements when the  stakes are high. The difficulty with using unanimous agreement as the decision rule is that  most people don’t know how to search for Both/And solutions.  Instead,  people pressure each other to live with decisions that they don’t truly  support.  And the group often ends up with a watered-down compromise. This problem is a function of the general tendency of groups to push for a  fast decision:  “We need unanimous agreement because we want  everyone’s buy-in, but we also want to reach a decision as quickly as  possible.”  This mentality undermines the whole point of using unanimous  agreement.  Its purpose is to channel the tension of diversity, in service of  creative thinking – to invent brand-new ideas that really do work for  everyone.  This takes time.  In order to realize the potentials of unanimous  agreement, members should be encouraged to keep working toward  mutual understanding until they develop a proposal that will receive  enthusiastic support from a broad base of participants. High-Stakes Decisions MAJOR DECISION RULES:  USES AND IMPLICATIONS    Community At Work  © 2007     271     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  “FLIP A COIN” MAJORITY VOTE Majority vote produces a win/lose solution through an adversarial process.   The traditional justification for using this rule when stakes are high is that  the competition of ideas creates pressure.  Thus, the quality of everyone’s  reasoning theoretically gets better and better as the debate ensues. The problem with this reasoning is that people don’t always vote based on  the logic of the arguments.  People often “horse-trade” their votes or vote  against opponents for political reasons.  To increase the odds that people  will vote on the merits of a high-stakes proposal, the use of secret ballots is  worth considering. High-Stakes Decisions Low-Stakes Decisions When expedience is more important than quality, majority vote strikes a  useful balance between the lengthy discussion that is a characteristic of  unanimous agreement, and the lack of deliberation that is a danger of the  other extreme.  Group members can be encouraged to call for a quick  round of pros and cons and get on with the vote. “Flip a coin” refers to any arbitrary, random method of making a decision,  including common practices like drawing straws, picking numbers from a  hat or “eeny-meeny-miney-moe.”  Who in their right mind would consider  using this decision rule to make a high-stakes decision? High-Stakes Decisions Low-Stakes Decisions Knowing the decision will be made arbitrarily, most members stop  participating.  Their comments won’t have any impact on the actual result.  However, this is not necessarily bad.  For example, how much discussion is  needed to decide whether a lunch break should be 45 minutes or an hour? MAJOR DECISION RULES:  USES AND IMPLICATIONS    Community At Work  © 2007    272   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    MAJOR DECISION RULES:  USES AND IMPLICATIONS PERSON-IN-CHARGE DECIDES AFTER DISCUSSION There is strong justification for using this decision rule when the stakes are  high.  The person-in-charge, after all, is the one with the access, resources,  authority, and credibility to act on the decision.  Seeking counsel from  group members, rather than deciding without discussion, allows the  person-in-charge to expand his or her understanding of the issues and  form a wiser opinion about the best course of action. Unfortunately, some group members give false advice and say what they  think their boss wants to hear rather than express their true opinions.* To overcome this problem, group members can design a formal procedure  to ensure or include “devil’s advocate” thinking, thus allowing people to  debate the merits of an idea without the pressure of worrying whether  they’re blocking the group’s momentum.  Or group members can schedule  a formal discussion without the person-in-charge.  They can then bring  their best thinking back to a meeting with him or her to discuss it further. High-Stakes Decisions Low-Stakes Decisions There are three decision rules that encourage group discussion:  unanimous  agreement, majority rule, and person-in-charge decides after discussion.   With low-stakes issues, all three decision rules produce results that are  roughly equivalent in quality. Low-stakes issues provide a group with the opportunity to practice giving  honest, direct advice to the person-in-charge.  When the stakes are low, the  person-in-charge is less likely to feel pressured to “get it right,” and is  therefore less defensive and more open-minded.  Similarly, group members  are less afraid of being punished for taking risks. * Irving Janis, in his ground-breaking classic on the group dynamics of conformity, Victims of  Groupthink (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1972), describes many case studies demonstrating this  problem.  For more suggestions on ways to overcome this problem, see pages 207-224.    Community At Work  © 2007     273     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  MAJOR DECISION RULES:  USES AND IMPLICATIONS PERSON-IN-CHARGE DECIDES WITHOUT DISCUSSION When a person-in-charge makes a decision without discussion, s/he  assumes full responsibility for analyzing the situation and coming up with  a course of action.  Proponents argue that this decision rule firmly clarifies  the link between authority, responsibility, and accountability.  Detractors  argue that this decision rule creates a high potential for blind spots and  irrationality. The most appropriate time for a person-in-charge to make high-stakes  decisions without discussion is in the midst of a crisis, when the absence of  a clear decision would be catastrophic.  In general, though, the higher the  stakes, the riskier it is for anyone to make decisions without group  discussion. How will group members behave in the face of this decision rule?  The  answer depends on one’s values.  Some people believe that good team  players are loyal, disciplined subordinates who have the duty to play their  roles and carry out orders.  Other people argue that group members who  must contend with this decision rule should develop a formal mechanism,  like a union, for making sure their points of view are taken into account. The fundamental point is that whenever one person is solely responsible  for analyzing a problem and solving it, the decision-maker may lack  essential information.  Or those responsible for implementation might  sabotage the decision because they disagree with it or because they don’t  understand it.  The more the person-in-charge understands the dangers of  deciding without group discussion, the more capable s/he is of evaluating  in each situation whether the stakes are too high to take the risks. High-Stakes Decisions Low-Stakes Decisions Not all decisions made this way turn out badly.  In fact, many turn out just  fine.  And when the stakes are low, even bad decisions can usually be  undone or compensated for.

THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT DECISION RULES ON PARTICIPATION Person-in-Charge Decides  After Group Discussion When the person-in-charge is the final  decision-maker, s/he is the main person who  needs to be convinced.  Everyone tends to  direct their comments to the person-in-charge. Majority Vote Since the goal is to obtain 51% agreement, the  influence process is a battle for the undecided  center.  Once a majority is established, the  opinions of the minority can be disregarded. Unanimous Agreement  When everyone has the power to block a  decision, each participant has the right to  expect his or her perspective to be taken into  account.  This puts pressure on members to  work toward mutual understanding. Person-in-Charge Decides  Without Group Discussion This decision rule gets group members in the  habit of “doing what they are told.”   At meetings, they listen passively to the  person-in-charge, who talks and talks without  being challenged. Each decision rule has a different effect on group behavior.  Individual  group members adjust the quantity and quality of their participation  depending on how they think their behavior will influence the decision.   275 WORKING WITH  GRADIENTS OF AGREEMENT ➧  Unanimity and Consensus  ➧  Intro to the Gradients of Agreement Scale  ➧  Using the Gradients of Agreement Scale ➧  Gradients of Agreement in Action:       Enthusiastic Support       Lukewarm Support ➧  When to Seek Enthusiastic Support ➧  What Level of Support is Optimal? ➧  Gradients of Agreement in Action:       Ambiguous Support            Majority Support with Outliers ➧  Adapting the Gradients of Agreement Scale ➧  Methods of Polling the Group STRIVING  FOR UNANIMITY18 18    Community At Work  © 2007    276   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    STRIVING FOR UNANIMITY Consensus also has Latin origins.  Its root word is consentire, which is a  combination of two Latin words:  con, meaning “with” or “together with,”  and sentire, meaning “to think and feel.”  Consentire thus translates as  “to think and feel together.”   Consensus is the process – a participatory process by which a group thinks  and feels together, en route to their decision.  Unanimity, by contrast, is the  point at which the group reaches closure.   Many groups that practice  consensus decision-making use unanimity as their decision rule for reaching  closure – but many groups do not.  For example, the Seva Foundation uses  “unanimity minus one.”  So does the renowned collective, the Hog Farm.   Some chapters of the Green Party use 80% as their acceptable level of  agreement.  Yet all such groups consider themselves to be sincere adherents  of a consensus decision-making process.   In these cases, no single member has personal veto power.  Nonetheless,  individual voices wield significant influence – enough to ensure that the  group will engage in a genuine process of thinking and feeling together. INTRODUCTION UNANIMITY AND CONSENSUS THE POWER OF UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT The word unanimous comes from two Latin words: unus, meaning “one,”  and animus, meaning “spirit.”  A  group that reaches unanimous agreement  is a group that acts from one spirit.  By this understanding, a unanimous  agreement can be expected to contain wisdom and soundness of judgment,  because it expresses an idea that is felt by each person to be true.  As the  Quakers say, the decision speaks for everyone. To reach unanimity, everyone must agree.  This means that everyone has an  individual veto.  Thus, anyone who perceives that his or her interests are not  being taken into account can keep the discussion alive for as many hours or  weeks or months as it takes, to find a solution that works for everyone.  This  veto capacity is the crux of the power of unanimous agreement.  When a  group is committed to reaching unanimous agreement, the members are in  effect making a commitment to remain in discussion until they develop a  solution that takes everyone’s needs into account.    Community At Work  © 2007     277     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  A SILENCE IS NOT AN AGREEMENT Many managers want their teams to be strongly aligned in relation to the  high-stake, high-impact issues that most affect their work.  When tackling  such issues, these managers come to meetings with statements like, “I need  to get everyone’s buy-in today.”  Clearly, these managers want their groups  to achieve unanimous agreement. Yet if we look at how such meetings play out, what actually happens?   The  discussion may go well for a time, but once the group becomes mired in the  Groan Zone, the person-in-charge often feels pressure to bring the discussion  to closure and make a decision.   To close discussion, it’s common for a person-in-charge to summarize a key  line of thought and say something like, “It sounds like people want to do  such-and-such.”  Then s/he will follow with,  “Does everyone agree with this  proposal?”  Typically, after a few seconds of silence, this person will say, “All  right, we’re agreed.  That’s what we’ll do.  Now let’s move on.” Is this actually a unanimous agreement?  Not really.  The manager has no  idea, really, what the people who didn’t respond were thinking.  THE PROBLEM WITH YES AND NO Unanimity means that every person has said “yes.”  But “yes” does not  necessarily mean, “Yes, this is a great idea.”  It could also mean, “Yes...  well... I have reservations, but I guess I can work them out when we  implement it,”  or even, “Yes, though actually I don‘t much care for this  idea, but I’ll go along with the majority.  I want to be seen as a team player.” Moreover,  someone who says “no” is saying, in effect, “I require the group  to spend more time on this discussion.”  This causes most group members to  be very hesitant to say “no.”  They do not want to feel responsible for  dragging out a discussion. Thus, the “yes-no” language is a fundamental problem.  To strive for  unanimity, group members need a way to accurately and authentically  convey the extent of their support (or nonsupport) for a proposal. STRIVING FOR UNANIMITY IDEALISM  vs REALITY    Community At Work  © 2007   Abstain “This issue  does not  affect me.” Serious  Disagreement “I am not  on board  with this – don’t count  on me.”  More  Discussion Needed “I don’t  understand the  issues well  enough yet.” Agreement  with a Minor  Point of  Contention “Not perfect,  but it’s good  enough.” Support with  Reservations “I can  live with it.” Don’t Like But  Will Support “It’s not great,  but I don’t  want to hold  up the group.” GRADIENTS OF AGREEMENT BETTER VOCABULARY This is the Gradients of Agreement Scale.  It enables members of a group to express their support for  a proposal in degrees, along a continuum.  Using this tool, group members are no longer trapped  into expressing support in terms of “yes” and “no.” The Gradients of Agreement Scale was developed in 1987 by Sam Kaner, Duane Berger, and the staff  of Community At Work.  It has been translated into Spanish, French, Russian, Mandarin, Arabic  and Swahili, and it has been used in organizations large and small throughout the world.   Whole-hearted Endorsement  “I really like it.” 1 2 3     Veto “I block this   proposal.” 8 7 6 5 4   Community At Work  © 2007     279     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  HOW TO USE THE GRADIENTS OF AGREEMENT SCALE Before the meeting, post the Gradients of Agreement Scale on a flipchart.   Some facilitators show the chart to the group at the beginning of the  meeting and obtain the group’s agreement to use it.  Other facilitators  don’t introduce it until the group is ready to make a decision.   When the time comes to take a poll, follow these steps: • Step 1:  Record the proposal under discussion on a flipchart.   • Step 2:  Check to see that everyone understands the proposal.   • Step 3:  Ask for final revisions in the wording of the proposal.  • Step 4:  Draw a scorecard below the proposal, as shown on this page. • Step 5:  Ask, “How do you like this proposal?”  • Step 6:  Take the poll.  Capture everyone’s positions on the scorecard. Note that the result is not a vote or a decision; it’s just the record of a  poll.  It indicates the extent to which a group supports a proposal. • • 1 3 5 7 ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ 2 4 6 8 “Proposal:  Sell our warehouse  and lease a new facility.”    Community At Work  © 2007    280   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    GRADIENTS OF AGREEMENT IN ACTION: ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORT This diagram portrays the result of a hypothetical poll, taken in a group of 13  members.  The pattern of responses – also known as “the spread” – indicates a  high level of enthusiastic support for the proposal.   An agreement based on this much support will usually produce a successful  implementation.  After all, six members of the group are whole-hearted in their  endorsement,  and the others are not too far behind.  One could reasonably  expect that these participants would care about the results they produce.  Words like buy-in and ownership carry the same connotation as enthusiastic  support – they express the depth of enthusiasm and commitment groups  experience when they engage in a high-quality thinking process that results in  high levels of endorsement.  6 Members 4 Members 2 Members 1 Member Abstain Serious  Disagreement Veto Whole-hearted Endorsement More  Discussion  Needed Agreement  with a Minor Point of Contention Support with  Reservations Don’t Like But Will  Support 1 8 7 6 5 4 3 2   Community At Work  © 2007     281     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  This diagram portrays the result of a different poll, taken of the same 13-person  group.  Here, the spread indicates significantly less enthusiasm for the proposal.   Nonetheless, this spread also indicates unanimous agreement.  Not one person  would veto this proposal and block it from going forward.  In fact, there is no  serious disagreement with it whatsoever.   For many purposes, lukewarm support is perfectly adequate.  For example,  when the stakes are low, it is usually not worth pushing for a higher level of  support.   But in other cases, when achieving a goal will require high  motivation and sustained effort, lukewarm support just won’t do the trick.

And when is lukewarm  sufficient?  Here are some variables that help to answer this question: Source:  Paul C. Nutt, Solving Tough Problems (San Francisco:  Jossey-Bass, 1989). * OVERALL IMPORTANCE Enthusiastic support is desirable whenever the stakes  are so high that the consequences of failure would be  severe.  By contrast, when the stakes are lower, a  group may not wish to invest the time and energy it  takes to develop enthusiastic support. OVERALL IMPORTANCE Some decisions are not easily reversible – for example,  the decision to relocate headquarters to a new city.   Decisions like these are worth spending whatever time  it takes to get them right.  But others decisions – such  as the question of how to staff a project during an  employee’s two-week vacation – have a short life-span.   To get such a decision perfectly right might take  longer than the entire lifetime of the decision. DURATION  OF IMPACT  DURATION  OF IMPACT When many people have a stake in the outcome of  the decision, it is more likely to be worth the effort to  include everyone’s thinking in the development of  that decision.  When the decision affects only a few  people, the process need not be as inclusive. STAKEHOLDER BUY-IN STAKEHOLDER BUY-IN The chief factors that make problems hard to solve are  complexity, ambiguity, and the severity of conflict.   The tougher the problem is, the more time and effort  a group should expect to expend.  Routine problems,  by contrast, don’t require long-drawn-out discussions. * DIFFICULTY DIFFICULTY The more likely it is that members will be expected to  use their own judgment and creativity to implement  a decision, the more they will need to understand the  reasoning behind that decision.  The process of  seeking enthusiastic support pushes people to think  through the logic of the issues at hand.

When it occurs, the question arises as to  whether the group should disregard the objections of the outliers or whether  the group should keep making efforts to resolve those objections. Often the person-in-charge of the group will try for a compromise, asking those  with objections if they can suggest remedies that would increase their level of  support.  Sometimes this works.   But not always.  It depends on whether the situation requires enthusiastic  support.  When everyone’s strong support is needed, lukewarm compromises  will not do.  In those cases, the group must continue searching for a genuinely  inclusive solution.  3 Members 4 Members 2 Members 1 Member Abstain Serious  Disagreement Veto Whole-hearted Endorsement More  Discussion  Needed Agreement  with a Minor Point of Contention Support with  Reservations Don’t Like But Will  Support 1 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 2 Members 1 Member    Community At Work  © 2007    286   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    ADAPTING THE   GRADIENTS OF AGREEMENT SCALE Many group leaders prefer to create their own set of gradients, whether to suit  their leadership style or to fit the group’s culture.

Ask whether s/he would like to customize the scale.    4. Once the person-in-charge has revised the scale, have him or her           present the scale to the group, soliciting further revisions if desired.  Even when a group uses the generic scale for the first few decisions, it is entirely  fine for the leader (or the participants) to propose modifications at a later time.

Frequently, the problem is that the person-in-charge does not feel obligated  to use a single decision rule.  “Sometimes,” said a division manager, “I want  everyone in my group to agree to a plan before we act on it.  At other times I  don’t want to waste time, so I make the decision myself.” From the point of view of the person-in-charge, it does not make sense to be  tied down to a particular rule.  But from the perspective of the group  members, the inconsistency can be enormously confusing. For example, a software publishing company held monthly meetings that  were chaired by the chief operating officer and attended by all department  managers.  The managers complained that the meetings were very  frustrating.  “Sometimes the boss cuts off discussion after five minutes,” they  grumbled.  “At other times he lets it run on and on.  Sometimes it seems like  he wants us to buy into a decision he’s already made; other times he couldn’t  care less what we think; and then there are times when he wants us to figure  out every little detail.  It’s driving us crazy!” This is an intriguing example.  From the perspective of the person-in-charge,  his behavior was perfectly logical!  He knew what the decision rule was –  the  person-in-charge makes the decision after group discussion.  But in each particular  case he made a judgment call to determine how much discussion the issue  warranted.  At times – when the stakes were low or when a solution seemed  obvious – he decided it was fine to make a quick decision with very little  discussion.  At other times, when he wanted everyone to take ownership of  the outcome, he kept the discussion going in search of better ideas. The problem was that he did not share this reasoning with the group.  He  made all his judgments in his head.  The group members had no idea that  there was a method to his madness.  To explain his apparent inconsistency,  they made up all kinds of stories:  He was manipulating them.  He was  fearful of corporate politics.   He was incompetent as a leader. This example perfectly illustrates the classic tension between the need for a  flexible procedure and the need for a clarified procedure.  The person-in- charge felt that clarifying his decision rule would handcuff him.  He needed  the flexibility to allocate time wisely.  But leaving the decision rule vague  didn’t work, either.  It prevented the group members from knowing whether  and when their manager valued their participation.   REACHING CLOSURE FLEXIBILITY  vs. CLARITY   Community At Work  © 2007     291     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  This diagram portrays a situation that comes up all the time in groups:  at a  certain point in practically every discussion, the person-in-charge has to  decide whether to end the discussion and make a decision. To most people who play the role of person-in-charge, this fact is intuitively  obvious.  They recognize the situation because they deal with it every day.   But it is not so obvious to the other participants at a meeting.  They often  don’t know how to interpret what’s going on.  As a result of such confusion,  people can become frustrated, angry, and passive – exactly as happened in  the example on the previous page. Fortunately, it is easy to reduce the disparity between the perspective of the  person-in-charge and the perspective of the other members.  The solution is  to show everyone what the person-in-charge is doing.  Show a simple diagram  like the one drawn above, and explain the options.  When the choice point  is made explicit, the confusion is removed. The Discussion  Reaches a Stopping Point The person-in-charge decides  that the discussion has been  adequate.  S/he  feels ready to  bring the issue to closure by  making a final decision. The person-in-charge decides  that important issues still  need to be thought through.   S/he wants the group to  continue the discussion. OPTION  A OPTION  B * The word meta is Greek and means “above” or “about.”  Making a decision about whether to  make a decision is thus called making a meta-decision. REACHING CLOSURE THE META-DECISION  *    Community At Work  © 2007    292   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    THE DOYLE AND STRAUS FALLBACK One of the most well-known meta-decision procedures is the Doyle and  Straus fallback.    Here’s how it works. Whenever a new topic is introduced, the person-in-charge sets a time limit.   During that period of time, the group will strive to reach a unanimous  agreement.  If time runs out, the person-in-charge makes the meta-decision:   either s/he will now bring the discussion to closure and make a final  decision, or s/he will set a new time limit and reopen the discussion. CAROLINE ESTES’ VOTE TO VOTE Meta-decisions also occur in groups that have no person-in-charge.  For  example, the U.S. Green Party, which uses unanimous agreement as its  decision rule, has a meta-decision that allows it to switch from unanimity to  majority vote.  This meta-decision, called vote to vote, was popularized by  Caroline Estes, one of the nation’s leading experts in the field of large-group  consensus decision-making. The Greens have adapted this procedure:  any group member can call for a  vote to close discussion and switch from unanimity to majority.   Immediately following this call, the vote is taken.  If 80% of the voters favor  switching, the discussion ends, and the group uses majority rule to reach a  decision on the proposal at hand; if fewer than 80% want to switch, the  unanimity rule remains in effect and the discussion continues. SAM KANER’S META-DECISION This procedure is shown on the next page.  Its central premise is that polling  helps a group obtain maximum benefit from the use of a meta-decision. In groups with a person-in-charge, it is highly advantageous for that person  to use a Gradients of Agreement scale to take a poll before s/he makes a  decision.  If s/he sees adequate support from the group, s/he can make a  decision with confidence that it will be implemented.  However, if s/he sees  that a proposal lacks sufficient support, s/he can reopen the discussion  rather than make a decision that would be difficult to implement. THREE META-DECISIONS * ** M.

Mechanics of Reaching Closure This is the Community At Work procedure for reaching closure at  meetings.  This procedure allows groups to make simple decisions  quickly, and it also supports them to take as much time as necessary  when the stakes are high and the impact is substantial.  It provides  groups with the benefits of participatory decision-making whether or  not their organizations are hierarchically structured.

DISCUSS EACH STEP 3. Facilitator:  Describe the gradients of agreement  and explain how your polling process will  work.  Then explain the meta-decision.   Facilitate a group discussion of each step.  Record all suggested revisions on the flipchart. Facilitator:  Have the group use the proposed  procedure to end discussion.  Then poll for  support of suggested revisions, and have the  person-in-charge make the meta-decision.   Usually there are several suggestions to deal  with.  If so, take them one at a time, repeating  the sequence until all revisions have been  ratified or rejected.  Finish by polling for  support of the entire final product. 4. 4. REVISE  AND RATIFY Person-In-Charge:  Show the group your  proposed decision-making procedure in its  entirety.  Use a flipchart so you can make  changes easily.   SHOW YOUR PROPOSAL 2. 2.

Community At Work  © 2007    302   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    Closure Zone ✔ SYNTHESIS REFINEMENTS DECISION POINT The Closure Zone can be viewed as the final phase of decision-making.  It consists of four distinct steps:   1. End the discussion.   2. Write a proposal on a flipchart.   3. Poll the group members.   4. Use the group’s decision rule to reach a final decision. Sometimes these steps can be navigated quickly and informally, without the  help of explicit procedures – for example, when someone proposes a clear,  compelling solution to the problem at hand and everyone gladly accepts it.   But in the long run, for all the reasons discussed in this chapter, groups will  benefit from establishing an explicit, formal decision rule – even if they use it  only occasionally.  Facilitators are advised to study carefully the principles  covered in this chapter.  Understanding the mechanics of reaching closure is  essential for anyone who wants to help a group build sustainable agreements.

ATTEMPTED DECISION Closure Zone SYNTHESIS    Community At Work  © 2007     305     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  When a new topic comes up for discussion in a group, people normally  begin the conversation by proposing obvious solutions to obvious problems.   The emotional atmosphere is usually congenial but superficial.  People  refrain from taking risks that would put them in vulnerable positions.  If an  idea seems workable, it usually leads to quick agreement.  “Sounds good to  me,” people say.  The facilitator’s main task during this phase is to pay  attention to the quality and quantity of each person’s participation.  Is  everyone engaged?  Does everyone seem comfortable with the discussion? If so, great!  The facilitator then summarizes the proposals under  consideration and helps the group reach agreement quickly. But suppose some people in the group do not support the proposal – as  indicated by statements like, “I don’t think this will work, but I don’t want  to stand in the group’s way.”  The facilitator can support the group to see  the implication of these comments – namely, that more thinking would be  useful.  Then, the facilitator can help them break out of the narrow band of  familiar opinions and move their discussion into the Divergent Zone.

ATTEMPTED DECISION Groan Zone Business as Usual Convergent Zone Closure Zone Divergent Zone When a facilitator supports a group to move from Business as Usual to the  Divergent Zone, the mood changes dramatically.  Business as Usual discussions  are tedious and stiff; people censor themselves rather than risk being  embarrassed by criticism.  In contrast, laughter and playfulness are common  in the Divergent Zone.  So are feelings of curiosity and discovery.  (“Whoa,”  said one group member to another.  “You mean that’s your point of view?   I had no idea!”)  What creates such a difference between the two zones?  To a large extent,  the answer is simple:  the attitude of suspended judgment.  Suspended judgment is one of the most important thinking skills facilitators  can teach their groups.  Facilitators can provide groups with opportunities to  experience suspended judgment through formats like brainstorming and  go-arounds.  By teaching suspended judgment and by modeling it whenever  possible, a respectful, supportive facilitator can create a relaxed, open  atmosphere that gives people permission to speak freely – the very essence  of divergent thinking. ZONE    Community At Work  © 2007     307     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING  FACILITATING SUSTAINABLE AGREEMENTS THE AGONY OF THE GROAN ZONE  TIME  Once a group has expressed several diverging points of view, the members  face a quandary.  They often don’t understand each other’s perspectives very  well, yet they may not be able to resolve the issue at hand until they do  understand each other.  This is one of the fundamental problems of working  in groups. Even in groups whose members get along reasonably well, the Groan Zone is  agonizing.  People have to wrestle with foreign concepts and unfamiliar  biases.  They have to try to understand other people’s reasoning – even when  that reasoning leads to a conclusion they don’t agree with.   The difficulties are compounded by the fact that many people respond  awkwardly to this kind of stress.  Under pressure, some people lose their  focus and start rambling.  Others become short-tempered and rude.  Some  people feel misunderstood and repeat themselves endlessly.  Others get so  impatient they’ll agree to anything:  “Let’s just get this over with!  Now!” disgust disgust exasperation exasperation perplexity perplexity confusion confusion ✔ DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES NEW TOPIC SHARED FRAMEWORK  OF UNDERSTANDING COMPETING FRAMES  OF REFERENCE FAMILIAR OPINIONS ?

This is a mistake.  The only way to insulate a group from the Groan Zone is to  block them from doing the hard work necessary to build a shared  framework of understanding. What, then, is the facilitator’s task in the Groan Zone?  Essentially, the job is  to hang in there – hang in and support people while they struggle to  understand each other.  Support them to hang in there with each other;   support them not to give up and mentally check out. The facilitator’s tenacity is grounded in a client-centered attitude – a faith that  the wisdom to solve the problems at hand will emerge from the group, as  long as people don’t give up trying.  It is this attitude that allows a  facilitator to tolerate the labor pains of authentic collaboration. ✔ DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES NEW TOPIC SHARED FRAMEWORK  OF UNDERSTANDING COMPETING FRAMES  OF REFERENCE FAMILIAR OPINIONS ?

ATTEMPTED DECISION Groan Zone Business as Usual Convergent Zone Closure Zone Divergent Zone Once a group has a developed a shared framework of understanding,  everything feels faster, smoother, easier.  The pace of discussion accelerates.   People say, “Finally, we’re getting something done!”  Confidence runs high  during this period.  People show up on time and stay until the end of the  meeting.  Between sessions, work that needs to be done gets done. The experience of searching for an inclusive solution is stimulating and  invigorating.  People are surprised to discover how well they seem to  understand one another.  Members now perceive the group as a team. Years later, many people can still remember the joyful intensity of this phase. Facilitators play a double role during this period of a group’s work:   sometimes teaching and sometimes getting out of the way.  It may be crucial  for a facilitator to teach participants how to turn an Either/Or problem into a  Both/And solution.  Often the facilitator is the only one who recognizes that  Both/And thinking is even possible.  But for much of the time, a facilitator  might be reduced to chartwriting and keeping track of time.  When this  happens, be happy!  It means the facilitation is succeeding.    Community At Work  © 2007    310   FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING    ✔ SYNTHESIS REFINEMENTS DECISION POINT Convergent Zone In the Closure Zone most people are focused.  They pay attention to nearly  every comment – and most comments are brief and to the point. These experiences occur, of course, only when the group knows how the  decision will be made.  When a group does not have a clear understanding of  how they are going to reach closure, the facilitator must look for the earliest  opportunity to help the members clarify their decision rules. The tools for reaching closure might be the single most important set of  thinking skills a facilitator can teach a group.  The Gradients of Agreement  Scale helps members discern the actual degree of support for a proposal.   Furthermore, a meta-decision procedure allows a group to use different  decision rules for different circumstances.  Overall, when group members grasp the principles and mechanics of  reaching closure, their group’s capacity strengthens dramatically. alertness truthfulness completion suspense satisfaction FACILITATING SUSTAINABLE AGREEMENTS THE EXPERIENCE OF REACHING CLOSURE    Community At Work  © 2007     311     FACILITATOR’S GUIDE TO PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING   TIME  The facilitator’s mission is to support people to do their best thinking.  The  four functions shown above are the guiding principles for enacting that  mission. Embedded in the four functions are the core values of participatory  decision-making.  They ground the work of group facilitation.  They  strengthen individuals.  They strengthen the whole group.  And they enable  groups to tap the deep collective wisdom of their membership to develop  intelligent, sane, sustainable agreements. When we facilitate, we are the “delivery system” for participatory values.   We embody them, we express them, and we enact them.  As such, we are  keepers of the flame – we’re the advocates, the teachers, and the midwives –  for the emergence of inclusive solutions to the world’s toughest problems.

The first and most important acknowledgment goes to our  editor, Barbara Hirshkowitz, whose vision and commitment to  this project is the reason this book exists.  In early 1988 Barbara  took Sam and Duane on a retreat and convinced us to write a  serious theoretical book on participatory decision-making.  Over  the next four years, with help from an ever-changing team of co- thinkers, we wrote countless drafts and felt dissatisfied with  them all.  Barbara patiently encouraged us to keep going.  In late  1993, Barbara saw that we had produced about a hundred pages  of facilitation tools, and she persuaded us to publish the book  you are now reading.  So Barbara shepherded us through two  years more of revising and adding and reorganizing and  ambivalating . . .  And finally, thanks to Barbara’s unwavering  faith and persistence, you have in hand the results of her labor. Second recognition goes to Kathe Sweeney, our editor at Jossey- Bass.  Kathe was instrumental in bringing the second edition  into existence.  For four patient years, she encouraged us to  update this book and make it available to the vast audience of  Jossey-Bass readers.  Without her perseverance we would not  have this created this edition.  Beyond her editorial relationship  to Community At Work, we are also deeply grateful to Kathe for  her vision and stewardship in promoting group facilitation, both  as a profession and as a calling.  She has been midwife to many  important books on collaboration, facilitation, and participatory  values – books that may never have been written without her  support and gentle guidance.  In the true sense of the word,  Kathe Sweeney is a leader in our field.  Many colleagues and friends contributed to the development of  the second edition.  We are particularly indebted to Libby  Bachhuber, who joined the staff of Community At Work in  1999, and who worked diligently for the next six years to help us  improve the logic of our most frequently used pages.  Libby‘s  insights into the application of those tools led to numerous  upgrades.  She was the person who kept track of all revisions that  found their way into this edition.  Her determination to get the  details right inspired us to keep working to clarify our reasoning  and strengthen our writing.   319 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Susan Lubeck and Sunny Sabbini also joined the staff of  Community At Work in 1999, and both contributed in many  ways to the development of material for this edition.  Susan  Lubeck, now a senior associate at Community At Work, put  much effort into strengthening our tools for reaching closure.   Many of the revisions in our chapters on decision-making were  occasioned by her suggestions.  Susan has been facilitating and  teaching from Facilitator’s Guide since the book’s inception, and  she drew from her broad experience to give us many ideas for  other improvements.  Sunny Sabbini is now a collaboration  specialist at Community At Work.  For five years until 2004 she  served as client relations coordinator.  In that role she collected  feedback from countless readers on the book’s strengths and  improvables.  She thus provided us with a steady stream of  suggestions for making the book more useful to our audience.  Many other people deserve to be mentioned for their  suggestions or their help in preparing the manuscript for the  second edition.  Evi Kahle was a constant source of assistance  and advice in 1995-2000.  Diane Dohm assisted with the editing  of our materials in 2002-03.  Buffy Balderston assisted with  editing and production in 2004-06.  Karen Jovin gave us many  useful ideas for improving Chapter 3.  Roxane White provided  incredibly helpful editorial assistance during the final stage of  editing.  Thanks to each of you for the many ways your support  made this book a better product.  We also heard from several people who pointed us to books and  articles worth including in the bibliography.  Thanks to Miriam  Abrams, Carmen Acton, Muriel Adcock, Teresa Archaga, Kate  Armstrong, Emmanuel Asomba, Susan Auerbach, Vicky Baugh,  Candee Basford, Lisa Behrendt, Leslie Boies, Tree Bressen, Trish  Cypher, Shoshanna Cogan, Lisa DeGroot, Stacey Duccini, Anne  Forbes, Scott Gassman, Gayle Gifford, Michael Hailu, Gloria  Hargrove, Doug Horton, Cynthia Josayma, Julie King, Eliska  Meyers, Jady Dederich Montgomery, Kathryn Moran, Cookie  Murphy/Pettee, Wayne Nelson, Evan Paul, Laura Peck, Jim  Roscoe, Cathy Stones, Mady Shumofsky, and Odin Zackman.  Thank you each for your thoughtfulness and your generosity. Many colleagues and friends influenced the development of the  first edition of this book.  Herman Gyr and Eileen Palmer  deserve to be singled out for first honors.  They each made  deeply significant contributions over several years time.  We  hold them both in gratitude and high esteem.   320   We would also like to thank several others who contributed to  the first edition.  Marianne Laruffa gave her wholehearted  support and encouragement to this project in its earliest forms,  from 1988–1990.  Rick Peterson helped refine the organization  and logic of early drafts in 1990–91.  David Barkan in 1990 was  the first “road-tester” of the meta-decision-making procedures  described in Chapter 19.  Pat Morris in 1990-91 co-authored the  second draft of our collection of structured thinking activities.   Gene Bush, who since 1992 has given us countless hours of  perceptive editorial advice, also provided the insightful critique  which led us to discover the Groan Zone.  Jim MacQueen co- authored a 1992 draft of the decision-making chapters.  David  Kirkpatrick co-authored early drafts of two structured thinking  activities.  Amaran Tarnoff co-authored early drafts of many  pages for Chapter 7.  Nancy Feinstein drafted an introduction to  Chapter 7.  Julie King copyedited a draft of the full manuscript.   Ritch Davidson co-authored two structured thinking activities.   Michael Tertes co-authored drafts of six case studies for Chapter  16.  He also co-authored early drafts of four structured thinking  activities.  Ritch Davidson, Rob Lawrence, Mitch Glanz, Nancy  Feinstein, and Melanie Burnett were readers for the final draft.   Sam Fisk was the behind-the-scenes maestro who kept  everything running smoothly. Evi Kahle edited and contributed  to the logic of Chapters 6, 14, 15, 16 and 20, and her dedication  and enthusiasm sustained us through our last year of writing. We would like to extend our appreciation to the proprietors of  the cafes where much of this book was actually written. In San  Francisco thanks to Farley’s, Cup O’ Blues, The Daily Scoop,  Thinker’s Cafe, La Boheme, Radio Valencia, and Sally’s.  In Aptos, a  nod to the Red Apple Cafe.  Also, a special thank you to a special  host.   Desideriamo ringraziare i proprietari della Nave in  Sperlonga, per le affabili ed affettuose attenzioni elargite a Sam  mentre scriveva le revisioni di questo libro. Il calore umano ed  un illimitato senso di ospitalità di tutta la famiglia hanno  lasciato un profondo segno che può ancora essere sentito tra le  righe di ogni pagina.  We want to express our gratitude to the  proprietors of La Nave in Sperlonga, Italy, who treated Sam so  graciously while he wrote the first revisions of this book. The  whole family’s warmth and their boundless hospitality left an  afterglow that can still be felt between the lines on every page. Last, our deep appreciation goes to Gene Bush, Monika Steger  and Paul Blakely.  You opened your homes and your hearts to  us, and loaned us your partners – often at personal sacrifice.  You  share our success as your own.   321 SAM KANER, Ph.D.   Sam Kaner is the founder of Community At Work.  His first full- time job as a facilitator was in 1978.

This “groupware” system  makes it possible for participants to give feedback quickly in  response to presentations and discussions.  This, in turn, allows  for themes to be distilled from the feedback, and responded to  by presenters, persons-in-charge, or participants.  In this  manner, even large groups have a solid chance to build shared  understanding and alignment in time frames commonly spent  on presenting and reporting only. Over 15 years, CoVision has supported hundreds of facilitators  and consultants in the use of the WebCouncil method.  In the  client cases of many of these facilitators, situations arise where  an upcoming meeting is seen as critical to the organization.  In  those cases, extra attention and resources are given to ensure  sucessful outcomes.  It is in these situations where CoVision  adds the most value, supporting facilitators as they provide fast- feedback capabilities to their clients.  CoVision gives advice  about, for example, planning the agenda, selecting various fast- feedback processes, making transitions, managing difficult  dynamics, or coaching the persons-in-charge. This methodology has proven effective in groups of 15 to 5,000  participants.  In the first Clinton Global Initiative conference in  New York, 800 world leaders spent two days in interactive panel  discussions enabled by WebCouncil.  The mayor of Washington,  DC, held four Citizen Summits, each engaging 3,000 citizens  with fast-feedback processes. CoVision has supported the World  Economic Forum as well as scores of Fortune 500 companies –  often in alignment meetings of 80 to 300 executives.

CoVision is an organization  development firm that supports  clients in their best efforts to  achieve extensive discussion and  alignment, especially in large and  important meetings.

Our  motto is “building  models of collaboration and putting them into practice.” AS A THINK TANK    Our purpose is to study the actual dynamics  of collaboraton and group decision-making – and to build more  accurate models – in order to support people to find sustainable  solutions to the world’s toughest problems.   We intend our models to combine insights from psychology and  the other human sciences with the practical ingenuity of the  business community, grounded in a philosophy of social  responsibility.

We specialize in providing collaborative  approaches that enable our clients to address their most  perplexing, system-level challenges.    Community At Work’s consulting services have been put to good  use in many different work-settings, from high tech to health  care.  Over time we have developed content-expertise in social  entrepreneurship, community-based planning, and social  enterprise.  We also have numerous clients in education, human  services, environmental health and international development. To support our clients in their work we employ a variety of  consulting competencies:  we assess and diagnose; we facilitate;  we coach; we create, test and produce relevant models; we  project-manage; we advise; we conduct training to build capacity  – all this and more, as dictated by the needs at hand. A distinctive feature of our work is a determination to support  our clients to think intelligently about the challenges they face.   We are committed to helping people learn skills for putting  participatory values into practice.  To this end we provide clients  with training in the concepts and skills of collaboration.
