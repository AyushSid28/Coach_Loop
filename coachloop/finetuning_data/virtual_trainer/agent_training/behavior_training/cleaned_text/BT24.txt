Learning Companion for Facilitators FACILITATION STEP-BY-STEP A SELF-LEARNING PORTFOLIO TOOL FOR  FACILITATORS IN NON-FORMAL EDUCATION  2  A self-learning portfolio tool for facilitators in non-formal education,  developed by  in the program  supported by  ©MitOst Association, Berlin 2017 Reviewed edition ISBN: 978-3-944012-32-2 www.mitost.org/editions   Editor: Nils-Eyk Zimmermann, with contributions of  Marta Anna Gawinek-Dagargulia, Teona Dalakishvili,  Elke Heublein, and Monika Nikzentaitis-Stobbe  3 ROLE OF A FACILITATOR Facilitating a training in non-formal educational  settings can be very different than the kind of  teaching that takes place in schools. Traditionally,  a teacher is a person who primarily disseminates  knowledge. Facilitation, on the other hand,  involves accompanying people during a learning  process in which they develop competencies.  Facilitators create the right conditions for  individuals to form knowledge and skills in a self- directed way, according to their specifc needs.  This is one aspect of empowerment.  When taking the role of a facilitator seriously as  giving people power and helping people  becoming powerful, our profession is better  understood with a new defnition: a shift from  teaching to facilitating, moderating, and  encouraging. As a facilitator who empowers groups  and individuals, it is essential to be aware of the  key concepts in self-directed learning, strengthening the autonomy of a learner.  A self-learning tool The idea of this learning companion is to support  your self-development as a professional, to help  you fnd your defnition of a facilitator through  observation, practice or individual work. What you save here represents in sum our  portfolio of competences and your characteristics.  The companion helps you to collect experience  and makes it accessible for (self-) evaluation in a  systematic way. We encourage you to write, paint,  draw or however it is comfortable for you to  express yourself. Beyond individual learning it  might be helpful for you to include other people.  Different perspectives complement the picture.  Focus on existing knowledge The shift from teaching to facilitating can be  described through the term resource orientation.   Facilitation seeks to focus on an individual’s pre- existing knowledge, skills, and potential. The  difference between empowerment and traditional education lies in the attitude toward the target  group of people learning. In teacher-centered  learning, the teacher is the cook and hopes that  the group will enjoy the dish and its ingredients. In a facilitative approach, everyone may cook. In the  best-case scenario, everybody is exploring the  recipe, the ingredients and spices that help him or  her best. But it only works when facilitators really  believe in what they are saying. Do you trust in  your learner's capacity to act successfully?  Facilitation involves granting your participants’  experience and knowledge more relevance than it  has in traditional teaching. In this sense,  facilitation is a step toward sharing expertise and  appreciation.    Structure of the Companion A is about your attitude as a facilitator,  learning style, and development goals. B focuses on the institution and the  concrete learning environment. C  is the section with templates for concrete    practice. Therefore the pages of this section  may be copied and flled out each time.  D is all about the evaluation and refection    of your whole learning process.   4  Situational and shared Leadership Knowledge and experience represent the two  sides of a coin when it comes to the kinds of  learning that take place in facilitation or in  traditional teaching. A facilitative attitude seeks  to connect experience in a seminar room with life  experiences and knowledge in a more useful way.  Participants or learners usually know which  approaches, topics, and learning styles work well  for them. As a facilitator, your methodological  skills help them bring their motivation and  interests into play, and help foster a collaborative  learning process. Facilitators help learners to fnd  motivation, identify goals, develop action  strategies, refect on their existing skills, and  identify their challenges.  This has also some consequences for your position  within the group. In traditional educational  settings, the role of a facilitator is clear – their  place is standing in front of the group. According  to our philosophy, this is somewhat different: As  facilitators, mostly we still stand in front of the  group, but more often we’re in the background,  observing from the sidelines, acting as moderators or coaches. Sometimes participants even will take  the lead. The challenge is to fnd the position that works  best for the learning process as a whole. With  regard to your role, you might face specifc  questions, such as: Do I need to explain something here or should I focus on active group work? What  part of the explanation that I have prepared is  really useful?  Relationships When the boundaries between facilitator and  participants become more fuid, challenges for  facilitators can arise. Sharing the same values and  vision of a participative and pluralistic civil society  is a prerequisite for creating a trusting atmosphere where participants can open themselves to others.  On the other hand, situations continually crop up  where facilitators have to give orientation, act as a  role model, or inspire others through their own  experience or expertise.  In a shared and holistic learning environment,  facilitators are also included in the process, on  cognitive, experiential, and emotional levels. Our  relation to the participants has a direct impact on  the learning process. The challenge is to establish  a trusting relationship with our participants while still keeping the intended outcome in mind, unless the facilitator is primarily responsible for achieving the  outcome. In other words: We are part of the game,  but are also partners with a larger responsibility  for the whole. A good relationship between  facilitators and learners may lead to an experience Teaching vs. facilitating One directional dissemination of  knowledge  Accompanying and shaping a learning  through a teacher   process together  5 where learning and facilitation feel like they are taking place more or less automatically – a nice process for  both parties.  Participatory Facilitation Participation refers to the various mechanisms people use to express  their opinions and exert infuence on  social decision-making. Genuine participation takes place through partnership, in which a  negotiation process is used to distribute power  between facilitators and the people learning (in a  civic engagement, this occurs between citizens  and power holders). In this process, decision- making is shared.  For example,  →You wouldn’t just propose two alternatives, but  would ask open-ended questions about what  participants want to learn.  →You would let them co-decide what content  and methods they would like to use.  Following this logic, the highest level of  participation involves people taking action and  making decisions about their situations  independently.  →You might delegate your power to participants  and let them act as experts in front of the  group.  →You might have them conduct a training or unit among themselves, independently from you.  The challenge is to fnd the position that works  best for the learning process as a whole. With  regard to your role, you might face specifc  questions such as: Do I need to explain something  here or should I focus on active group work? What  part of the explanation that I have prepared is  really useful for active participation?   Diversity-Consciousness Focusing on individual needs implies the insight  that everybody is different. Our participants have  different styles, attitudes, experiences, or cultural  and social backgrounds. Most school systems often tend to homogenize this diversity. Facilitation  means to respect and even to appreciate the(se)  difference(s) as a resource. In the best-case scenario  everyone gains from more diversity-consciousness  realizing that different roads may lead to similar  goals and that it is often the other strategy that  might help you in your work.  On the other hand the challenges are clear. First,  when taking consciousness of diversity seriously,  we need to integrate it into real life conditions.    Diversity-consciousness as a process Several roles: stepping into different shoes  6  These can be limited time resources, a not always  consensus oriented heterogeneous group, or an  environment outside our working place, where  diversity is seen as something alien.  Second, when individuals or groups violate our  non-violent and democratic principles – these  need to be (re)established. Diversity consciousness is a learning feld and therefore we cannot assume  that everybody recognizes our values.  Furthermore, our task is to act as role models and  to convince through authentic and credible action. Here abstract theory shows in concrete behavior in front of a group. From the language we use to our  attitude toward different people.  Dealing with difference How can we bring people together in times of  confict? How can we overcome the gap that  racism, terrorism, war and other forms of violence  create in our societies and in our minds? We better  should acknowledge that confict and violence  exist in the world around us and are therefore  'silent visitors' in our learning space. And honestly  speaking – wouldn't it be boring to live on an  island of harmony without disagreement and  contrasting opinions? Therefore, we facilitate the  skill of learning to live with disagreement.  Confict occurs when a person has a need and that  need is not met. In conficts, at least two parties  are involved (individuals, groups, states, etc.). At  times, it can seem that meeting one party’s need is incompatible with meeting the other party’s need. Every confict has its positive and negative sides,  and these depend on various factors. However, we  know that conficts are disruptive and can be  destructive. But conficts also contribute to the  creation of positive relationships and to the  improvement of bad relationships through  transformation. By employing good conflict  management, facilitators improve the quality and  effciency of communication in a group and equip  participants with confict management skills Staying open to self-development Facilitators stimulate others’ learning processes  and create spaces for it. This implies the use of  dynamic lenses to be able to observe group  processes, foresee needs and motivations, and  codesign the process accordingly.  However, focusing on others may lead to a lack of  focus and space for the facilitator's individual  learning processes. This is an important  consideration, because facilitators are expected to  be role models for learning. Therefore, facilitators  develop skills and abilities to learn from a variety of  experiences and in diverse contexts: formal and  non-formal, group settings and individual  personal interactions, outdoors and indoors, when  communicating to a broader public and conveying  messages but also in their own private lives, where they need to create space for personal refection.  In other words, being a facilitator and imparting  holistic learning, means committing to being a  lifelong learner.  We wish you inspiration,  motivation and fun!  5 Competendo  The open source toolbox on competency- centered learning offers more information.   → competendo.net   7      A ------------------------- YOUR ATTITUDE AND PERSONAL LEARNING GOALS -------------------------    8  ATTITUDE TOWARD FACILITATION The term attitude (or similar terms like 'position' or  'mindset') plays an important role when it comes  to describing educators’ skills. The 'right' attitude  of a facilitator is a crucial resource for educational  processes. But what does 'right' mean? We  recommend fve basic features of attitude that you can work on to develop your skills as a facilitator.  Facilitators with a holistic attitude… →Try to understand the feelings and needs of  their learners  →Pay attention to their relationship with learners (relationship as partnership), they don’t only  focus on the content  →Are open to dealing with different opinions  and conficts resulting from them  →Are interested in their self-development  as facilitators  Attitude and the idea of citizenship How facilitators perceive terms like 'democracy',  'empowerment' or 'activism' has an infuence on  how their participants experience these topics.  Furthermore, participants are perceived as  credible and authentic change-makers in their  community, if they share a democratic and  empowering attitude as well. In other words, civic  competences are to a big extent attitude – beyond  knowledge and skills.* Education for active  citizenship needs to shape opportunities for the  development of democratic, inclusive and  respectful attitudes toward other people – it  begins in your seminar room with your way of  facilitation.   * Council of Europe: Charter on Education for  Democratic Citizenship and Human Rights Education:  http://www.coe.int/en/web/edc  Your symbol Which symbol do you connect with facilitation?  9 PROFESSIONAL FACILITATOR You bring with you experience and expectations regarding facilitation into your facilitator's team.

Another way to describe him or her is through so-called competences.  Competences are skills, knowledge, and attitudes, that one needs for effective action in a modern  society. They help you in a whole range of activities, therfore we speak here from 'key competences' or  'transversal competences'. Some competenceshave specifc relevance for your role as a facilitator in non- formal education. Please describe your competences that qualify you for the role of a facilitator: A2 Key Competences  Abstract Competencies  Task-specifccFactualcCompetencec Identifying adequate solutions for tasks and  problems on the basis of knowledge about the  specific field, and how it is systematically related  within its field and to other fields.  MethodologicalcCompetencec Acting consciously, adequately and in a goal-oriented way. An ability to choose methodologies and to  evaluate outcomes.  (Inter)Personal competencies  SocialcCompetence  Living in relation to other people and actively shaping social relations. Reflecting different interests, needs  and tensions.

Describe your expertise regarding  relevant topics, knowledge and methodology on how to facilitate: What do you want to explore?   A3 Methodology Relevant Topics  12  LEARNING STYLE There are different paths to insight. Some people like to act in a structured, logical and step-by-step  manner. Other people act intuitively and have no problem with open-ended tasks. There is a specifc way  of processing information in each learner's brain caused by spatial specialization (lateralization of brain  function). In a popular way it is explained as a general division between the left brain, cognitive and  abstract hemisphere and the right brain, more intuitive non-verbal, social or spatial hemisphere. Some  validated models exist that help you to refect on your way of learning and thinking, such as  Allinson/Hayes' Cognitive Style Index. It places individuals on a continuum between the two poles of  intuitive and analytical. Where on this continuum would you locate your stylistic orientation? Your learning style             Which of the words above best characterize your learning style?  Most people are somewhere along the continuum, therefore you may use words,  associated with both domains!  _______________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________ J.

You probably have an idea in your mind which specifc characteristics a good facilitator has. Our experience says that there is no one clearly dominant style of personality that is better suited than others for the work as a facilitator. Diversity in a team makes the difference. A more introverted facilitator will understand the needs of quieter learners more intuitively than an extroverted personality who in turn better refects the needs of very active people. For a person who likes to come quickly to the point, the moderation of an answer-open discussion may be a challenge; for a person who likes the process of discussing, coming to the point is more diffcult.  In general, all characteristics have positive potential for facilitation. It is down to you and your team to perceive the different qualities of your members in a realistic way and to use them effciently.  Your characteristics Try to describe your personality in one sentence that includes these domains. ___________________________________________ ___________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________   All characteristics form a specifc individual profle.

Different people have different styles to deal  with this. Although facilitating in an empowering way means applying your approach to the needs of the  target group, this can imply many different things. What does it mean for you?

Values are principles that give us  orientation on what we want to do and how we do it. Therefore the challenge is to act according to these  principles, not only in ideal conditions. But it is important to refect these values in a diffcult  atmosphere, such as in a confict among participants. Please elaborate on which are the important  principles for you in relation to the felds below.

Peers often  understand the reality of their participants better. Or they may mobilize more empathy or explain things  in an easier way. Peer facilitation can have two meanings. First, qualifying and using those people for  facilitation that feel close to the target group and have similar experiences. Second, when participants in  a group intensively learn from each other's experiences, feedback or best practice.  We often hear that younger facilitators especially enjoy the spirit of a group and become partially  involved in the group's dynamics. On the one hand, this supports the idea of peer facilitation. On the  other hand, too much involvement may infuence your professionalism: your preparation may be  lacking, your critical distance and evaluative competence may suffer, and sometimes you may become  disoriented as to where you belong.  For non-peers, the question of the right balance between closeness to and distance from participants is  also important. What if you do not represent the participants' group in terms of age or social  background? To what extent do you then need to actively shape your relation to participants – where is  distance the appropriate strategy in this case?

You therefore need to balance your tasks as a facilitator with your everyday life.  This checklist is about the environments, instruments and conditions that create optimal learning  conditions for you. Environment & space →Where in your everyday life is the best place  for learning? →What is the optimum time for reading, thinking, or planning? How often will you fnd this time? →Which people do you (not) need around you?  What inspires you? Your learning tools  Everybody has different preferences  for saving and refecting knowledge.  What kind of tools will you use during your facilitation practice? Digital  protocols or manual sketches? PDFs or hard-copies? Talking to colleagues or  writing? Drama or experiment?

Corporate Culture Whether or not you fnd something from an organization convincing has to do with the image. The  image is created through the way how the staff, volunteers or participants behave, how the materials are  designed, or how others feel they are being addressed.

The impact of such an initiative can be described as the effect which it has on the  neighborhood, environment, or broader society. This checklist is on how your work relates with their impact.  Or in other words: What effect your facilitating has. 'Empowerment' in your words Citizenship education and competence-centered learning are connected with the idea of  'empowerment'. In a way empowerment underlies your work as a facilitator.

The mentioned aspects can as well fgure as  indicators for measuring the success of your  (common) work for evaluation.  Evaluation is the structured interpretation of what  was happening and giving of meaning to results or 'outputs'. This will happen during and after  processes, after an important step in your seminar  or after each day, after you performed in front of a  group, or in a facilitators' team meeting. This section offers templates for concrete practice. Therefore the pages of this section may be copied  and flled out each time.  33 TARGET GROUP What characterizes the specifc target group of your training?

Life experience is gained from planned  activities, accidental inspiration, challenges, or  even disappointments. The linear parts of your  'learning curve' are less interesting from an  evaluating perspective. The most valuable sources  for refection are its ambiguous areas. Maybe this  is a characteristic of experiential learning - success  and failure balance each other.  Holistic facilitation mobilizes a lot of key  competences (you described these in A2). These  are in example planning and organizing skills,  attitude development, communication skills,  moderation skills, or any interpersonal skill  relevant for shaping group processes.  Now is the point for looking back and taking stock.  Based on this assessment you might identify your  future opportunities and your development goals . Taking stock What do you know? As a facilitator you gained  experience, you read and talked with other  facilitators and experts. →You might assess what kind of expertise is  characterizing your individual portfolio.  Future goals →How is your further learning path looking like?  What could be a next realistic goal?  →What would complete your competence profle as a professional facilitator? Motivational drivers →What would you like to learn?   →What motivated you and where would you  probably engage with intrinsic motivation?  47 PROFESSIONAL FACILITATOR At the beginning you thought about what your ideal professional facilitator might look like. What do you think now after having worked in the “kitchen of empowerment” for a while?  What tools, raw materials and  skills does a facilitator need?
