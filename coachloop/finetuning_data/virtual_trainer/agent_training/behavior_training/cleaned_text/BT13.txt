And that runs from the cognitive story at  the core through to the learning prescriptions that emerge. Quite simply, we have  a responsibility.  If a doctor pursues approaches unjustified by science, they’re liable for mal- practice. Similarly, we should be implementing scrutable practices. There are  consequences for not doing so. If we use approaches that aren’t justified, we can  squander resources, but more importantly, we can undermine our own goals. In  the worst case, lives are lost. In fact, you’ll see that industries with significant  potential downsides of getting it wrong practice in ways not typically seen in cor- porate America. Look at the military and airlines as two examples. So, we have a responsibility to our learners, our organizations, and ourselves  to understand and apply what’s known, whether from a deep-seated curiosity and  caring, or just because it’s what’s required of us.  I come from the former category. I was kind of at loose ends, degree-wise. I  was tutoring (physics, calculus, chemistry) on campus for some extra income, and  taking some computer science courses. I ended up doing computer support for the  office that coordinated the tutoring. And a light went on: computers supporting  learning! My university didn’t have an appropriate degree program (back then,  many didn’t; I was carrying around decks of punch cards in order to run the com- puter programs), but it did have a way to design your own. So, that’s what I did,  and learning design and technology has been my career ever since.  I’ve programmed educational computer games; gone back for a PhD in  what was, effectively, applied cognitive science; and gone the academic route: a  post-doctoral and then a faculty position. For complicated reasons, I also joined  some government-sponsored initiatives in online learning before joining a startup  in educational technology. When that went four paws to the moon in the eco- nomic chaos that characterized the collapse of the internet bubble, I ended up as a  consultant (which went from being a euphemism for unemployed to a way of life).  viii ﻿Preface However, my career has always been about exploring ways to use technology that  allow us to pursue our goals more effectively and efficiently.  Along the way, I’ve maintained a passionate interest at the intersection of  four related fields. I’ve looked at learning—behavioral, cognitive, post-cognitive,  social, educational, even machine learning—to see what’s known. Similarly, I’ve  followed what’s known about engagement, including motivation, anxiety, curiosity,  drama, and humor, to understand how we create experiences that are meaningful,  even transformative. I’ve also followed technology trends from before personal  computers, including artificial intelligence, mobile, content systems, constructed  realities (augmented and virtual), and more, to find out what new capabilities we  might use. Finally, I’ve looked at design, including interaction, industrial, graphic,  software engineering, and of course instructional approaches, to ensure that we’re  applying this knowledge in the most useful ways.  That’s my mission: Discover how to create experiences that tap into our hearts  and apply our minds to achieve useful ends. It’s all about strategic learning expe- rience design (LXD). (And through technology, since I’m admittedly a sucker for  the latest toy.) Which means I have looked at practical ways to integrate this suite  of knowledge. Here, I’m focusing on learning, and its application to instruction. And, as you’ll see, our brains consolidate information. We don’t remember  many exact details; instead, we remember a synthesis. And that’s what I’m doing  here. This is not a detailed academic treatise, but rather an attempt to digest and  communicate a practical interpretation of what’s known about cognition and  learning to provide a basis for better design.  I hope you find it comprehensible and useful.   ix Acknowledgments There are so many people I owe gratitude to, and I’ve tried to catalog them in pre- vious books. A few who continue to support me include the following. Jim “Sky” Schuyler has been a mentor, colleague, and friend since out of col- lege and continuing on. A great role model.  Marcia Conner has been a mentor at stages in my career, providing opportu- nities and helping me learn important lessons.  My Internet Time Alliance colleagues, instigated by the late, great Jay Cross— Jane Hart, Harold Jarche, and Charles Jennings—all have served to improve my  understanding of learning and life. My IBSTPI colleagues, including Mark Lee, Kathy Jackson, Davida Sharpe,  Fernando Senior, Saul Carliner, Florence Martin, and Stella Porto, have been  sources of inspiration and learning. Thanks also to all my colleagues in many different forums; in particular (and  in no particular order), Will Thalheimer, Karl Kapp, Patti Shank, Julie Dirksen,  Mirjam Neelen, Donald Clark, Jane Bozarth, Jen Murphy, Chad Udell, Connie  Malamed, Matthew Richter, Guy Wallace, and the other mythbusters and science  interpreters have all helped shape my rigor and understanding. Apologies if I hav- en’t mentioned you! And I’m grateful to so many more colleagues who inspire me  and support us all in doing better.  I’m grateful to all the organizations that have given me platforms to share  my thinking on how to improve the field, through workshops, keynotes, talks,  articles, books, and courses. Thanks to societies, publishers, private organizations,  individuals, and more.  Also, thanks to the organizations that have brought me in to work with  them. It’s a deep pleasure to be able to get hands-on with real problems and try to  “Quinnovate” some new ideas. I’ve learned so much from these opportunities with  public and private companies, not-for-profits, governmental bodies, educational  institutions, and more. I’m also grateful to Justin Brusino, Alexandria Clapp, Jack Harlow, Melissa  Jones, Caroline Coppel, Hannah Sternberg, Shirley Raybuck, Rose Richey,  x ﻿ Acknowledgments Stephanie Shaw, and the rest of the ATD team who’ve pushed and supported  me through this experience. This book exists because of Justin and Alexandria  is immeasurably better because of Alexandria, Jack, Hannah, and Caroline, and  looks great thanks to Melissa, Shirley, Rose, and Stephanie.  My family—Erin (who served as a reviewer of an early draft), Declan, and  most of all, LeAnn—have been stalwart supporters. With love and gratitude.  1 CHAPTER 1 Introduction to  Learning Science •	 What is learning science? •	 Why we need learning science •	 How learning science is conducted •	 How to find learning science resources plunger (plŭnj r) The plunger in the pump was broken. A plunger is a:  (a) dolphin  (b) pump part  (c) brown car —A found example of online learning What possible learning purpose does this example serve? The question comes right  after the content. It asks a question where the answer is implied by the immediately  preceding material, and the alternatives are nonsensical or silly.  This example is emblematic of why we need learning science. Because when  we design learning experiences, we want to achieve an outcome. And, if we don’t  do it according to learning science, we could waste our stakeholders’ resources and  our learners’ time.  To address the need in this book, we’ll go through basic cognitive architec- ture, and then the learning phenomena (cognitive artifacts like mental models) of  reasoning that arise from this architecture. We’ll look beyond cognitive to emo- tional aspects, and we’ll point out the implications for learning experiences and  the design of specific elements.  First, however, we should establish more about the science we’re investigating.  2 Chapter 1 What Is This Learning Science? Learning science is, not surprisingly, the scientific study of learning. It means   looking at how learning works, and also what facilitates and hinders learning. It  provides a strong basis for designing instruction. It is relatively new, however. Our brains are the core organs of learning. We perceive the world, act, observe  the outcomes, and reflect. Consequently, studying learning comes from studying  the mind. The ancient Greeks philosophized about how our brains work, but  scientific exploration of learning really only began with Hermann Ebbinghaus’s  studies of memory in the 1800s (Figure 1-1).  Figure 1-1. Ebbinghaus’s Memory Study  100   80   60   40   20   0 .3 1 9 2 6 31 % Retention Days Elapsed Time Hours The field of psychology has subsequently gone through several movements,  including behaviorist, cognitive, and constructivist. Each of these added insights  have furthered our understanding.  The behaviorist school started out by saying that we can’t talk about what’s  going on inside the brain; we only can connect inputs with outputs. This was the  era of Pavlovian conditioning and stimulus-response approaches. Robust findings  include the value of different reinforcement schedules (think gambling; Figure  1-2) and the Yerkes-Dodson performance-arousal curve.  The cognitive revolution said that we can hypothesize what brain structures  must exist. Research showed various facets of our information processing that have  stood the test of time. There was a vision that we were formal, logical reasoners.  Revelations that we’re not the formal-thinking beings we thought prompted  the move to a more situated, or constructivist, view of cognition. Here, we realize   Introduction to Learning Science 3 that our thoughts are an interaction between context and previous experience. We  may use concepts differently depending on context, and certain types of reasoning  are problematic.  Figure 1-2. Reinforcement Schedules  # Responses Time Variable Ratio Fixed Ratio Variable Interval Fixed Interval Importantly, psychology isn’t the only field that talks about how our minds  work. Insight still comes from fields such as philosophy, neuroscience, linguistics,  anthropology, and sociology. The field of cognitive science was created to be an  umbrella under which these differing elements could be integrated. And it’s pro- vided a solid foundation for developments including communication and collabo- ration practices, interface design, and artificial intelligence. Learning science is similarly interdisciplinary. Research insights have come  from psychological investigations, educational studies, ethnographic approaches,  and sociological work. (A side effect is that results from one discipline may not  take into account results from another, related discipline.) A growing awareness of  this relatedness led to the establishment of the discipline in the 1990s. Learning science is also global. I was a graduate student in the United States  during the establishment of the discipline, and then a post-doctoral fellow. There  is so much research done in the US, it was easy for me be focused nationally  instead of internationally.  Later, I had the good fortune to take a faculty position in Australia, and quickly  (and shamefacedly) learned my awareness of research was blinkered. I was also able  to visit global conferences and get exposed not only to the field’s interdisciplinary  nature, but also to its global cohort of researchers. And it’s important to realize, and  recognize, that the results and implications properly span cultures and nationalities.  4 Chapter 1 Why Should We Care? Another plausible question is why learning science? Why should we understand  the underlying cognitive mechanisms, the artifacts and limitations of our mental  architecture, and the associated elements? Can’t we just follow the resulting pre- cepts of instructional design? I’ll suggest that the answer is a resounding “no.” My short answer is that it’s a professional imperative. Instructional design is  applied learning science. How can we claim to be scrutable in our approaches if  we don’t track the underlying research, and can’t articulate how our designs reflect  what is known? Just as you expect your doctor and financial adviser to be applying  the latest outcomes, so too should you feel such an obligation when designing  learning experiences. We don’t want to be guilty of design malpractice, after all.  The longer answer starts with the realization that instructional design is a  dynamic field. Even David Merrill, one of the founders of and forces in instruc- tional design (and a truly nice person to boot), has had phases of change. His  Component Display Theory, for instance, progressed to ID2, and now he’s on  about a “pebble in a pond.” New understandings in learning science drive the need  to revise our approaches.  The foundations we build our design processes on have shifted. Instructional  design emerged as an artifact of World War II, when behaviorism was in force. As  we’ve gone through the cognitive era and into a post-cognitive constructivist aware- ness, our design bases similarly adapted. Each of those transitions has had implica- tions for what we think learning is, and consequently what makes sense as pedagogy. Recent understandings continue to drive our approaches. To be able to react  to new approaches means grasping some fundamental underpinnings. Separating  them from other explanations is a critical component of being a successful practi- tioner. (I once was presented with a “hydraulic” model of learning, an engineering  metaphor misapplied to understanding our thinking!) This implies a second reason to understand the basics: Folks will continue  to propose new approaches. They will come to these approaches sometimes from  pure conviction, rightly or wrongly, but also for commercial reasons. Practi- tioners need to be careful about evaluating new claims. With an understanding  of the basic mechanisms, you’re better prepared to avoid the learning myths that  plague our field (as I documented in my last tome, Millennials, Goldfish & Other  Training Misconceptions).   Introduction to Learning Science 5 Also, instructional design has great recommendations, such as we see in the  movement to evidence-based methods as discussed in recent books by Ruth Clark  and by Mirjam Neelen and Paul Kirschner. Thus, a third reason is that there are  still gaps that prescriptions won’t fill. Making good choices in lieu of guidance  depends on understanding the mechanisms as suggested by theories.  How Does One “Learning Science”? Learning science is the result of the usual processes of science. While there are  many different methods, the basis we should be using is the result of experimen- tally tested and statistically validated approaches.  A major distinction is between quantitative and qualitative studies. In quan- titative studies, you have clear metrics that are objectively obtained, such as scores  on tests or observationally clear performance while completing tasks. Here we  typically have some subjects working in one way (such as under the experimental  treatment), and a control group in another, typically pre-existing, way, and we then  look at the outcomes.  Statistics are used to determine with some degree of certainty whether the  outcome is due to chance (Figure 1-3). It is a probabilistic game, because even  significant tests have a chance of being false 5 percent of the time. This is one of  the reasons it is preferable if the results are replicated. Reputable reports, such as  those in a peer-reviewed journal or book chapter, will detail the study sufficiently  so that someone can conduct the same study. And this happens. Figure 1-3. Statistical Significance Probability of Observation Set of Possible Results 95% of observations Statistical signiﬁcance (= unlikely by chance) Statistical signiﬁcance (= unlikely by chance) 6 Chapter 1 Note that despite their empirical nature, experiments tend to be driven  by theory. While there are some purely experimental studies (“What will  we find?”), most times someone creates a hypothesis, and then tests it. For  instance, someone may say, “Hmm, one prediction of cognitive load theory  might be that we need to integrate labels into diagrams to keep people from  generating more mental overhead by looking back and forth between them,  trying to integrate the element and its meaning.” They run a test, and find out  if it’s true (spoiler: it is).  Qualitative studies similarly use the scientific method, but they take data  that’s more complex than just numbers (verbal protocols, interviews) and code it,  and then look for patterns. Typically, you need some controls on the interpretation  to support the resulting analysis, such as someone independently coding a subset  of the data and looking for the agreement. For my PhD thesis, for instance, I  coded transcripts of subjects’ verbal efforts in problem solving. As a control, I also  hired a student to code a subset of the data using my rubric, and checked to see  that the coding was reliably consistent. Finding (and reporting) that the degree of  agreement was sufficiently high meant that we could then report that the data was  reliably coded.  Importantly, your data should get reported in a journal. What this means  is that you write it up in unambiguous language and peers review it, and it must  pass scrutiny. Along with the results, you situate your work in others’, via a lit- erature review, and you make clear what the unique contribution is. The peer  scrutiny can be a problem, particularly if the work is upending established pro- tocol. There’s a whole field of science about science, and concepts like Thomas  Kuhn’s paradigm shift are used to characterize the bigger changes. Yet overall  the process works. Be aware that the language used for journals is an obscure dialect known as  academese. This is typically based on English, but uses an esoteric and almost  deliberately impenetrable vocabulary. It takes training to be able to compre- hend it. Learning to read academese is a valuable skill, but probably not for  most folks.  At its core, however, the systematic process of experimentation and theory  advancement, as well as theory revision and replacement, is all part of science. And  its results are the best basis upon which to determine our approaches.   Introduction to Learning Science 7 On the Lookout for Learning Science As suggested, the best way to track science is to read journals. And, again, not  everyone should be expected to read them. The nuances of appropriate methodol- ogies are subtle, and not necessarily of use to all. What to do instead? Fortunately, there is a cohort of folks who are reliable translators. In addition  to the scientists—those who can reliably communicate to laypeople, and that’s not  all of them—are folks steeped in the traditions (typically with PhDs from experi- mental programs) but who work in the real world. A number of them continue to  serve as valuable proponents for applications of the science.  These translators write blog posts, articles, chapters, and books. They present  via webinars, conferences, and keynotes. You should know them, listen to them,  and, of course, hire them. They can do workshops to educate your team, consult to  improve your processes, and help you plan to better align. They’re the source of the  best principles to apply to your practices. I maintain a list of the best translators at  quinnovation.com/translators.html. And you should know the places where transla- tion writings aggregate. Not every place is rigorous about the quality of its materials.  The Rest of the Book With that all said, what am I going to cover? I think it’s important to work our way  up from the fundamentals of the brain to what that means for learning. This means  a steady progression through several areas (Figure 1-4).  Figure 1-4. Book Structure Wrapping it Up Implications Emotions Artifacts Neural      Useful Meta Emergent 8 Chapter 1 First, we’ll look at our cognitive architecture using a “stores and processes” model.  Here we’ll learn the basic information-processing cycle, from sensed signals to  long-term memory. The artifacts for learning that emerge from this architecture are next. Tied in to  attention and working memory limitations is cognitive load. Similarly, specific ele- ments around models have implications from refining retrieval to developing content.  We’ll then review the phenomena that are outcomes of this architecture. We’ll  look at some more recent frameworks that document some characteristics of our  thinking that are not logical, and what that means. This includes looking at pro- cessing media. From there we’ll go beyond the cognitive to the emotional—or, rather, affec- tive and conative (who we are and our intent to learn). We’ll explore what’s known  about experience, motivation, and more.  We’ll also examine learning to learn. This important area is often neglected,  yet it can have an impact on success. This includes a culture of learning. Then we’ll delve into the implications of all this science on the elements of  learning design. We’ll explore introductions and closings, concept models, exam- ples, and, of course, practice.  And we’ll look at the elements in another way, as sets of prescriptions for  design. This includes two frameworks and a detailed example. Overall, our journey is: •	 Chapter 2: Our brains, from the neural level to the level of language •	 Chapter 3: Learning artifacts that arise from our architecture •	 Chapter 4: Some new perspectives with implications for learning •	 Chapter 5: The emotional side of learning •	 Chapter 6: Learning to learn •	 Chapter 7: Learning experience design implications •	 Chapter 8: How it all fits together That’s it—buckle up; it’s going to be a wild ride! Activities How do you get the most out of this book?  •	 Reframe the content, whether mentally, into different terms, or  physically, in terms of rewriting core ideas, mind-mapping the content,  or sketch-noting it.   Introduction to Learning Science 9 •	 Reflect on how the content explains things you’ve experienced in the  past, including good and bad learning. •	 As you work through the content, ask: What does this imply that I  should do (differently)? •	 Make it a habit to track learning science translations and translators.  119 References Bozarth, J. 2014.

Ensure Your Instructional Design  Stands Up to Learning Science Learning Science for Instructional Designers: From   Cognition to Application distills the current scope of  learning science into an easy-to-read primer. Good instructional design makes learning as simple as possible by removing  distractions, minimizing the cognitive load, and chunking necessary information  into digestible bits. But our aim must go beyond enabling learners to recite facts  to empowering them to make better decisions—decisions about what to do,  when, and how. Written by Clark N. Quinn, author of Millennials, Goldfish & Other  Training Misconceptions: Debunking Learning Myths and Superstitions, this book  prepares you to design learning experiences that ensure retention over time and  transfer to the appropriate situations. It will spark your thinking about how to use  these concepts and more in your daily work. Praise for This Book  “Clark Quinn’s new book offers compelling reasons for using learning science to inform your  practice. Following an ingenious path from the whys (how we process and store information)  to the hows, Learning Science for Instructional Designers is concise, understandable, and  exceedingly valuable.” —PATTI SHANK, LEARNING SCIENCE RESEARCHER, AUTHOR, AND FACILITATOR “Clark Quinn’s Learning Science for Instructional Designers is a delicious and irresistible box  of chocolates for all who want to architect effective learning. Focused on the practical and  covering an amazing breadth of science, this well-crafted book whizzes by, from one choice  nougat to the next.” —WILL THALHEIMER, RESEARCH-INSPIRED LEARNING CONSULTANT 112102	 $21.99
