And if you did do something about it, then you would feel totally amazing, healthy, strong, and you feel you're really doing good for yourself. Would that sum everything up?

VC23.txt,"is it today, Monday? I'm going to start it on Thursday. Thursday, perfect. , do you use a diary on a regular basis? Yeah, yeah I do. , I was going to say, busy family life, etc, then you're more likely to. , when are you going to put those blocks in your diary for you? , I will do it as soon as we're done. Perfect. And when it comes to exercising, do in your head what exercises you want to do? Have you got something that ? Yeah, I'm quite lucky at home I've got a weights bench and some weights and I know what YouTube exercise programs to follow. yeah, I know what to do. . , you've got all that planned. What could stop you? Nothing. Well, I could make an excuse for things to stop me, homeschooling's overrun, I haven't eaten in the time and it's too late, or I've got to go food shop, I can make excuses. Yeah, but if it's blocked out, you're saying... If it's blocked out. . Yeah. How could you set yourself up for success? What little things could you do around those times? As a for instance, that morning, say, Monday morning, when you get up, you could take your trainers and your gym stuff and you could make sure it's the end of your bed, or if you're not seeing a client you can get changed into them straight away. Can you think of anything that could help you to be successful, that you haven't got an excuse that could pop up that could get in your way? I think you just said a good one. If I'm not at work, if I put my kit on, then I'm in my exercise clothes, that's a big trigger. What I think would be good for me is to write a list the night before of my actions for the next day. And if I've got it there, instead of looking at my diary, if I write a plan of my day and exercise is in that plan. That tends to work for me. I'm a bit of a, I to know where I'm at with my day. Does that make sense? Perfect. Yeah, no, definitely. Yeah. , and I think, yeah, and it's in my diary as well. in my head, it's something that's got to be done. . I think that's my problem. I don't schedule it in. Yeah. I think I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it. And then something else takes its place, . For a lot of people, having a schedule makes it real. Yeah, yeah, I think it does for me. And I don't know why I've never scheduled it in before. Just another thing that might help motivate you, , are there friends and family members, your children, etc, that you could really appetise that these three days at midday, you are going to exercise and, , if you're not, then they need to ask you why. Could you do something along those lines, just to give you that extra little bit of if I don't do it, then I'm not, I'm failing and I'm failing in front of people. Some leverage, yeah. my son, Freddie, plays a lot of sport. He does, he's very strict with his exercise plan. if I said to him, I need you to, I need to be accountable to him, he would be on my case. Yeah, yeah, he's a good one. And my sister, Lindsay, she exercises a lot as well. she would be messaging me going, have you done it? Have you done it? Do what I mean? those two people. , I just want to double check that we've got the plan here. we are going to look at exercising three days a week, Monday, Sunday and Thursdays, it's going to be midday, , the sort of exercises you're doing, you've got the room to do it in. If you can, you're going to get up and get into your gym stuff that morning, but if you can't, then you're going to put it on your bed ready. You're going to speak to people your son and your sister to make sure that they know what you're doing.

VC23.txt,"be messaging me going, have you done it? Have you done it? Do what I mean? those two people. , I just want to double check that we've got the plan here. we are going to look at exercising three days a week, Monday, Sunday and Thursdays, it's going to be midday, , the sort of exercises you're doing, you've got the room to do it in. If you can, you're going to get up and get into your gym stuff that morning, but if you can't, then you're going to put it on your bed ready. You're going to speak to people your son and your sister to make sure that they know what you're doing. And, , you won't be just letting yourself down, you'll be letting them down, because they are aware of it. And you're going to put everything in your diary going forward after this call. And your first gym session is going to be this Thursday. Does that, have I got that ? You've got it perfect. Excellent. And how do you feel about that? I feel excited because now I feel it's going to happen. Yeah, yeah. Thank you very much. And I mean, this, this is in , we're way under 15 minutes. And we've come up with what the problem is, what's stopping you, how we can do it to make you accountable, a plan that's going to help you get to where you want to go. And you're feeling excited about it. Did you think you could do that in less than 15 minutes? No, you make it sound simple. , it's almost, it's almost when you speak to somebody about it, it becomes real. Do what I'm saying? Yeah, definitely. It's a little bit , we can think something, but until we say out loud, we realise either how bizarre it is, or how we're holding ourselves back.

VC24.txt,"Kelly thanks for coming in to speak with me. Thank you. What's the issue that you'd to talk about? What would be useful to explore? Well recently I've been thinking about my own professional development and making some investment in that again. I've always enjoyed my schooling and I've had a lot of schooling since I've been in the work environment but the past several years have not probably done as robust an investment as I had in the past and I've started to really miss that and I'm contemplating what my next step should be in terms of my own professional development. you're wondering what to do, what to study, all of that. Are you comfortable talking about that in this environment? Yes, absolutely. I'll ask you a bunch of questions. I'll try not to get too personal. If there's anything you'd prefer not to talk about, please feel free to pass on that. I guess the first question for me is how important is this as an issue for you? Is it number 10 on the radar? Is it number 5? Top 3? Where is it on your radar of things you're thinking about? Probably a 6, which may not sound high, but I find it rising. It's 6 and rising, . Rising with a bullet or rising slowly? Sort of in between. I would say that over time it's become more and more important. , how long have you been thinking about it for? I would say in earnest the past 6 to 9 months. It was sort of out there before that, but really in earnest the past 6 to 9 months. , alright. you're interested in working out what to do next in your professional development and it's about 6th on the priorities, but it's coming up. And about 6 to 9 months it's been coming up more. And how often do you notice it coming up? every day, every hour? Yeah, I would say every day at this point. And again, that's why I think it's rising as I'm noticing it more and more. Yeah, it's rising every day, . Alright, and is there an urgency involved with it? Is there a reason it's kind of coming up or is it just becoming more important over time? I think the urgency is partly sort of a personal drive that I miss. , I miss having something that's very tangible in my development. But also in my work environment, the role that I've been in the past year, year and a half, I think to go to the next level requires some investment. , . it sounds you're kind of itching for something new, for some stimulation there. Exactly. , excellent. Alright, how can I best help you think this through? I think maybe talking through maybe steps or maybe how to execute. Because I think once something rolls around in your mind for a while, it just sort of can stick there and be an interesting thought. But getting to the action portion can be a little more challenging. , are you at the stage where what you need to do and need to take action or you don't know? I think that's just the point where I'm trying to figure out what the action is, to be very candid with you. I think I know what some of my options are, but in terms of taking an actual next step, I'm not there. Have you set yourself a deadline yet? No, I have not. And that may be a good thought. I had had the thought previously that if by the end of the year I knew what I wanted to do, then I could do something in the spring. But I certainly hadn't put that in any firm, hadn't said that out loud, certainly hadn't put it in a firm statement. Yeah, well that's just my idea. I don't want to say that you should or have to set a deadline. It's just one possibility. . , , well it sounds you're at a point where you're ready to kind of move forward in some way. Are you clear about the direction and it's just a decision? Is that where you are? I think I'm settling on a direction. Maybe that's been part of the issue is trying to figure out which direction to go.

VC24.txt,"had the thought previously that if by the end of the year I knew what I wanted to do, then I could do something in the spring. But I certainly hadn't put that in any firm, hadn't said that out loud, certainly hadn't put it in a firm statement. Yeah, well that's just my idea. I don't want to say that you should or have to set a deadline. It's just one possibility. . , , well it sounds you're at a point where you're ready to kind of move forward in some way. Are you clear about the direction and it's just a decision? Is that where you are? I think I'm settling on a direction. Maybe that's been part of the issue is trying to figure out which direction to go. I think more and more I've settled on a direction, but again haven't taken any. . it sounds you're at that level of kind of firming up a lot of stuff. Are you interested in moving forward and seeing if I can help you move forward in that process? Yes. which area would be more useful to focus on, the decision or the action? Or sort of the area or the taking action? Action. Taking action, . what do you think you need to get yourself committed? I think probably to have conversations both at work and at home. I think for me part of the issue, now that we're talking through this, is that it's sort of a work-life issue. It's not one or the other, it's a little bit of both. I've got probably some conversations I need to have both at work in terms of getting support, because the direction is definitely in line with my professional career, but also managing what happens then at home as well. . have you started talking to those people and doing that? No. Ah, . Just at that point I've had the thought for a while, and I think it's just taking that brave next step of saying it out loud and making it happen. Yeah, and I appreciate your honesty and candor there. And the word brave, I can hear that. There's some energy in there, . , have you seen what there is to do next? Yeah, I think there are some conversations to be had. Again, and I guess it goes back to what I said earlier, when it's in your head it's one thing, it's the getting it out that almost in and of itself is the next step. Yeah, would it be a support to you to talk about a deadline for that, or are you clear when it's going to happen? No, I that idea. And I guess in keeping with some of the actions that I think I'd to take probably need to come to fruition in the spring. I think it really does, if I'm going to do it, necessitate making a decision before the end of the year and having those conversations, which again, having said that out loud now becomes more real. , even saying it twice is a little bit easier. I can see that. What about setting a deadline around when you'd have those conversations? Would that help you? Yes, yes. Yeah, and now that I'm thinking about that, I have an opportunity to have one of those conversations in two weeks because I have a career development meeting with my manager, that timing is probably sort of convenient. Yeah, and then in terms of having those conversations at home, there's certainly plenty of opportunity to do that. . I think the first thing is really to get at work to have that conversation. To do that first. Absolutely. you've got to clear a path now to speak to them in two weeks and then tackle the big one and do that at home. , how are you feeling coming out of this conversation? Good. I think being able to talk through it and just get it out loud and make it more real, that in and of itself is helpful. Yeah, it kind of looks you've got a clearer map of what to do from here. You look clearer about your personal plans. Yeah, I think . Great. Thank you. Thanks for coming in. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

VC24.txt,"to do that. . I think the first thing is really to get at work to have that conversation. To do that first. Absolutely. you've got to clear a path now to speak to them in two weeks and then tackle the big one and do that at home. , how are you feeling coming out of this conversation? Good. I think being able to talk through it and just get it out loud and make it more real, that in and of itself is helpful. Yeah, it kind of looks you've got a clearer map of what to do from here. You look clearer about your personal plans. Yeah, I think . Great. Thank you. Thanks for coming in. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Kelly, I'm really interested in hearing your experience of that conversation and just kind of breaking it down a bit and getting some feedback. I guess just overall, first of all, how was that for you, that coaching dialogue? That was good. It moved me forward without pushing me. In what way? Not that I want to just give myself lots of positive feedback here, but what did work? What worked for you specifically? Along the way, you did checkpoints with me about whether the next action was mine, essentially. Would it help if we set a deadline? You gently put the action back on me and held me accountable, but it was ultimately my decision. I got to choose which way we took the conversation. At every point that there was an action or decision, it was because I owned that. You may have prompted me about whether I wanted to own it, but ultimately I owned it. Yeah, and that's certainly important. I can remember the question. Would it support you to be setting a deadline in this area rather than what's your deadline, which would be much more intrusive. I guess I'm always trying to ensure that you are in the driver's seat making the decisions, and that way we're never hitting up against each other, that I'm helping you to think rather than telling you how to think all the way through. What else? Do you remember the moment when you had an insight? There was a moment that you smiled and came alive. Do you remember that moment? Well, one that sticks in my mind. I don't know if it's the one you're thinking of. When we were talking about would it help to have the conversation, it was , yeah, it would help. And this opportunity is coming up in just two weeks. Conveniently, it's there, and it will help move me forward. , there was a moment that you thought in an instant, , oh, I've got that meeting coming up, that could be my deadline. . And then once, what I thought I saw you think was, , once I have that meeting, then I could tackle the really hard conversation at home. Absolutely. And how did you feel in that moment when you made that connection? Almost a relief of, , it's not just floating around in my mind. It's not a worry or concern. It's an action now. And , , a little bit of excitement that it can move forward because it has been building over time. It's at a point where it builds, and it's not just an interesting thought anymore. You have to take it and go do something. Yeah, it kind of looked a spark of energy there. , oh, I know what to do now, and I can kind of see. And what if I'd said, this is a bit of a loaded question, I guess, but I want to ask it. What if I'd said, , why don't you bring it forward at your next career planning meeting? If I'd said that to you, what would you have done? , it still would have been a good idea. It wouldn't have been my idea, I suppose. it's not that I wouldn't have done it. I don't know that I would have owned it as fully, maybe. Yeah. maybe less chance that you would do it or something. . Yeah. What I appreciate about that conversation is that, again, I owned it.

VC2.txt,", Jeff, anything that you need in order to kind of create some safety and some space here in this moment with each other? No, I don't think . I mean, I think, , I know, I know everybody here and I'm very comfortable with with them and appreciative of this chance just to chat. Wonderful. And I'm going to pull down the curtains for myself that I'm just really focused in my conversation with you. , is there something you mentioned that you had a couple topics that you might want to talk about? Is there one in particular that seems most important to you? Yeah, I'm pondering either just my own just kind of way of managing work and what's important or my own wrestling with use of social media. And what what does that what does that mean or what is that my relationship to it maybe? . If you think of those two, which one is drawing you as the most important of the two? Probably how I manage my, yeah, my, my regular working life. Social media is always something that's , resonating in there. And maybe it's part of part of it, part of the management of the workspace life. I use it, I guess, primarily around promoting things this on Facebook or whatever. But it's not my favorite thing in the world. And, , Facebook was was down last week, was that last week, Facebook was down for six hours. I was , thank God. Who needs that? Take a break. rolling through that stuff. Yeah. managing this sort of work, work life, it almost sounds a little bit is the piece that seems most drawing your attention. Yeah. Yeah. What is the importance of that capacity, that, that managing of work? Well, I pretty much am my own boss of kind of, , I mean, I have a boss, I work with a team of people, we're, of course, given some things to do, but , how I'm ordering my days, what how I'm structuring things, how I'm managing things is , all in my court. And I've, and that's, that's really been the case, , I was a pastor for 17 years, started a church, kind of always been that self starter, self organizer, have found certain ways of managing and, and I think doing fairly well at that. But I'm also finding, , , just wondering how I could, , kind of improve that that space, wondering how, , how do I make my days the most kind of productive? How am I prioritizing? There's a little bit of everything that I'm, , doing from from coaching to retreat leading to trying to promote some of my own stuff along those lines of retreat leading and coaching also happens in the context of my job. And then just getting caught in the , I'm just answering emails for four hours and just kind of go into the next to do they're just hitting something to just get it off the to do list. And I have this experience of you now, , and please correct it if it's the wrong one. But I almost see you juggling, juggling, juggling. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a great metaphor. Yeah, the juggling constantly. Yeah, what does it do? , what what is the experience you would to be having at the end of the day from the all this juggling? Is there some experience that you would to have where you where you're not maybe juggling quite many things? Yeah, I think , I have the picture at the end of the day, I know when I have that kind of sense of , satisfaction at the end of the day, or able to , look back and feel I've as much as I'm a person that likes to be about being and kind of being centered. I also to get I to get stuff done. I things done. , if I look back on day, I'm , oh, this got done, this got done, this got done, this got done. And if it seems the significant, some significant pieces were cared for. That or, but sometimes that's not always it, ?

VC2.txt,", I have the picture at the end of the day, I know when I have that kind of sense of , satisfaction at the end of the day, or able to , look back and feel I've as much as I'm a person that likes to be about being and kind of being centered. I also to get I to get stuff done. I things done. , if I look back on day, I'm , oh, this got done, this got done, this got done, this got done. And if it seems the significant, some significant pieces were cared for. That or, but sometimes that's not always it, ? Sometimes it's looking back on a day and feeling because I'm , the the relational connections were meaningful there. , there's Yeah, something there because I just remember last week, there were several conversations that were coming up. And I was , looking to get into the zoom call and get out of the zoom call, ? it was , Oh, we got this half hour zoom call, we're gonna get it done. And then I got to go on to the next thing. And the half hour zoom call turned into an hour and 15 minutes. And it was probably the most significant thing of the day. Yeah, this this idea of juggling to towards moving towards satisfaction, but the satisfaction, if I'm hearing correctly, is really around how you're having meaningful relationships. Yeah, yeah, I drive a lot of my, I don't want to say value sense of purpose sense of in Yeah, in, in allowing for that space. And, and feeling impactful relationships or conversations or experiences are being had. But at times feeling pulled by all the , all the dang little Yeah, this Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. at the end of this conversation, what would make this most useful as we explore the the way that you show up meaningfully in relationships? Yeah, just maybe some way of just in my own sense of going, recognizing that, how can I be present in those in those moments when they're when they're given? What makes me fully present to those moments, and not get anxious about getting to the to the next thing or just getting this done? Because I want to be in this space with this person. But sometimes there's an anxiety of the urgency of the whatever's next. Yeah, there was an interesting question you just asked yourself, which is what allows you to be present in that moment? Yeah. Yeah. And it's being able to put aside the concerns with getting something done, or certain amount of things done, or not are being attentive presence being presence. With who's before me and not being driven by all the little things. I want to cross off the list by the end of the day. What is the experience that you have when you're in that fully present moment with another human being? Oh, it's just, and I think this is where coaching has been a wonderful, helpful process for me. It's not Princeton mentioned, having his own agenda, , and it's, it's truly finding myself in a place from , oh, I'm, I'm on board with whatever is happening here. I'm not trying to push my agenda for you. Or even to just , get to the end of the conversation or , how can we wrap this up? , oh, I'm just, we're here. And I'm in a more authentic posture of really listening. as you hear yourself say that, and there's the minutiae that needs to be juggled, but there's this also this sense of this, the meaningful connectedness that you also enjoy. How do you discern when it's , how do you discern when you need to shift your attention from one thing to another and then back? I mean, how do you make these discernments? , sometimes there's, there's, , when I'm not in a flow, there's not much discernment going on, ? It's just picking off the next thing.

How do you discern when it's , how do you discern when you need to shift your attention from one thing to another and then back? I mean, how do you make these discernments? , sometimes there's, there's, , when I'm not in a flow, there's not much discernment going on, ? It's just picking off the next thing. One thing that's helpful to me is, , I do have a practice of sometimes intentionally plotting out the day at the beginning of the day and writing in all the things that are going to happen. And, but also just understanding, I'm holding this loosely, but it's giving me some structure and some shape that , , after an hour of emails and to dues, I can, I can let that go, move, , move on to the next thing. It, it does help me be more fully present to whatever it is. I've kind of decided to put into that, that, that space. , I just think sometimes I I'm, I'm, I put way too much stuff into all the spaces. And how do you discern what things you need to stop juggling for? , how do you discern what all you're juggling? Cause it sounds you may be juggling even, I don't know. I just have this steep Martin vision all of a sudden. Yeah. How many cats can you juggle? Yeah. And, and I, I think I want to be more discerning about what I'm picking up the juggle. Yeah. And how do you start to pay attention and do that consciously with intentionality? Yeah. That's what I want to, that's what I want to figure out. Cause I mean, I'm, I'm called, there are things I have to do. There are things that need to be done, but are there other things that can be put down or not the priority or not essential? , and how do I just have a more discerning space around what it is? , I can hold. Is there a different energy or, or experience that you have when it is something that is really important that you pick up and juggle versus when you're juggling something that you really don't even have any energy for, but you're still doing it because it's on some list somewhere. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah, for sure. What is that? What is that shift for you? , it's just, , engagement, not, yeah, not feeling, , kind of heaviness or the weight of how am I pushing through this? There's, I mean, when it's the things that I'm truly enjoy or, or that engage me and create creatively, , there's more of a, , there's more of a lightness. There's more of a energy. , I think some of the difficulty around my just workspace overall now is , well, it's very isolated. It's just, it's me in my, in my, in my office here. I mean, I have a great team of people that I work with a great staff, but we're all kind of isolated cause we can't get together. And, , and when everything I've done, , for my job, the last two years has been on, on zoom. , , and I'm a relational person. I'm missing that, being in the room with others and playing off their energy and us getting creative together. It's just harder. It's harder to do on zoom. Yeah. Is it's harder to do on zoom. I'm not hearing it's impossible to do on zoom. No, cause it's happened on zoom and they're great things have happened. And I've led some virtual retreats that I feel people really have connected with and have found it to be some good life giving space. , part of that, because we kind of limited the zoom, it's not all on zoom. It was , Hey, go be, go be for a while for a little bit of a space with each other. I want to just touch base on, on where we are in the conversation. I know it was sort of this idea of the, all the things that you were juggling and life and then towards the satisfaction of meaningful relationships.

VC2.txt,"on zoom. I'm not hearing it's impossible to do on zoom. No, cause it's happened on zoom and they're great things have happened. And I've led some virtual retreats that I feel people really have connected with and have found it to be some good life giving space. , part of that, because we kind of limited the zoom, it's not all on zoom. It was , Hey, go be, go be for a while for a little bit of a space with each other. I want to just touch base on, on where we are in the conversation. I know it was sort of this idea of the, all the things that you were juggling and life and then towards the satisfaction of meaningful relationships. What else needs to be explored around this topic as we're, , I'm looking at the time in the next few minutes. I'm not, I'm not sure. Cause I really am not sure if there's a resolution. Yeah. And what if, what if there isn't a resolution, a resolution, but maybe something to sit with as a part of the exploration that's ongoing about how you determine. Yeah. Yeah. I, I mean, I the, the, the, the metaphor of the juggling or the kind of the, , or you could say that the spinning of the plates, the , I mean, there's a part of me that yearns for kind of less is more go deeper with fewer things and just wondering as, as I kind of look ahead, this next month for me is crammed with many, many things from now until Thanksgiving, but in December things kind of open up. And then looking at next year, I'm wondering if there's space here to sit with some discernment instead of just , part of me is ready to fill next year's calendar with, , coach trainings and retreats and all the things. And we're having a big staff retreat next week. And we're gonna be talking about all the things next year. I'm , I just, I do want to step into that. Not with this, , , what do I, what needs to be done? Yeah. , what shows up for me as you're saying that is almost , how do you create the healthy boundary that you need that you can, you can navigate this balance. It isn't a hard line balance. it's not, it's not a teeter-totter, ? It's, it's a wavy gray area, but how you navigate that intentionally. Yeah. Yeah. what are you taking away from this conversation? What's shown up is, is useful exploration. I think just for me, I just, I operate better when I can create the space to think about how I'm creating the space. , , to take the intentional time to, , look at the bigger, look at the bigger picture. And to be more discerning about how I'm holding that space and what needs done within it. Within it. I, I want to get back to, I used to take a day, a month of just true kind of contemplation being away from everything. And I'd to get back into that rhythm, which helps my discernment process. But I think it'd be great to couple that with a day, a month, that's truly just about the intentional process of me looking ahead and saying, what's next, what's important. And, and what action comes out of that awareness for you? Action, actions, depending. I need, I need to stick it on my calendar and stick to it. That's because it, it easily gets bumped. It's a contemplative prayer day. And then , oh, this thing or that thing, or, ah, well, , I got the contemplative prayer day. That's that space. Interesting. what holds you accountable to that, the importance of that agreement and honoring that for yourself? , well, I, I liked what you were saying earlier about trying to find that accountability within, within yourself, rather than saying, , oh, I should have, have Carolyn, my wife, , ask me every month or , because , honestly, that never works. Yeah. , but I, I, I think it's just really holding that space is what I am. All . Here's the thing. And here's my confession.

VC12.txt,"Hey Coaches, in this video you're going to see coaching by one of the InviteChange Master Certified Coaches, Carl Franco. This session was recorded by George Mason University and they have given us permission to share it with you here on YouTube. Thanks for watching and let us know in the comments what you think about this session where you would have made different choice points and other questions you might have asked. Eric, delighted to get to spend some time with you today in exploration and discovery. Hey, you too Carl, you too. Sorry, I'm just hiding my people who are... , now I've got your face. we got to put on a good show for these guys, Carl. No pressure, no pressure. I love how you said earlier, , I think I got something. I think it'll be good. I think . Yeah, how interesting that even that performance notion just always seems to be in the ether. Yeah, yeah. No, I was hoping that it's something that's come up. I was hoping I wouldn't have to decide because I knew there was coaching. I was , oh, maybe I can, I can. it's a real thing. I got a real thing. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. We're brand new to each other. We've got about 29 minutes in our history thus far. I wonder if there are, I'm curious if there are any agreements, , maybe a couple of agreements that we could put in place that would accelerate our trust in this partnership today? Yeah, yeah. One I can think of is if my face gets blurry, which it sometimes does, will you tell me? Because I'm looking at you, brother, not me. , I can do that. That's a simple one. That's a good one. Yeah, yeah. Anything meatier than that one? No, just , you're a coach, buddy, go for it. Yeah, yeah, all good. Yeah, don't have to, yeah, just do your thing, man. Yeah, that's why we're here. Yeah, that's all I got. Yeah, I'm not worried. Awesome. Where would you to be at the end of the session today? I'm really, and I can explain it. I want to get ahead of things. But I've got this question. It's about travel. I can tell you the whole, you want me to tell you the whole, kind of the background? Is that ? Yeah, I mean. , let me just give you the gist of it. I won't take long. Awesome. the gist of it, and just to call this out, the first world problem, there's people in Turkey digging out of rubble, there's war in Ukraine. this is a very first world thing. the quick version is, I grew up in Thailand, lived there till I was 17, came to the States when I was 18-ish, and went back once, and really haven't been back to Thailand since about 96. I went back when I was in early 20s. And since that time I've come to the States, I have happily married, I have family, I have all these kids and stuff. And I was supposed to take my family for the first time to Asia in the summer of 2020. But of course, the pandemic stopped that. And now we're trying to decide, we're looking at, well, and my kids are , I have two 12-year-olds, a 10-year-old and a five-year-old. And we're , is this the time we want to go back? And my wife and I are looking at airplane tickets. And just the flyest there is nine grand. And probably if we stay for a couple of weeks, it'll wind up being about 17 grand total. And my wife is , we can do this. And it's also my 50th birthday this year, too. that's fun. We can do this, but is this something you really want to do? And I'm really conflicted because in my mind, I'm , and I'm going to should myself. In my mind, I'm , I should. This is epic, of course. But I don't know if I'm feeling it. And part of my whole identity is wrapped up into bringing the family back to the motherland and hanging out with monkeys and elephants.

VC12.txt,"probably if we stay for a couple of weeks, it'll wind up being about 17 grand total. And my wife is , we can do this. And it's also my 50th birthday this year, too. that's fun. We can do this, but is this something you really want to do? And I'm really conflicted because in my mind, I'm , and I'm going to should myself. In my mind, I'm , I should. This is epic, of course. But I don't know if I'm feeling it. And part of my whole identity is wrapped up into bringing the family back to the motherland and hanging out with monkeys and elephants. And I have to let my wife know today because she's planning summer camps. this is all very, I don't know what the fuck to do. And to answer your question, I would love just to have some clarity around this. It's a very first world problem. But in this space where you and I are, there is no other world, ? Yeah. let's just release that as a pressure. . Yeah. I was going to ask, what has this being meaningful for you today? But you clearly answered that. Your wife needs an answer today. Yeah, kind of. Yeah. I mean, if we want a couple of days, it'd be . But yeah, sort of need an answer. Yeah. And she just emailed me how much to go on the Star Cruiser down at Disney, the price comparison. she's not saying, just literally while we were meeting you, she emailed this to me. I don't get pressure from her that it's not to do it. But she's sort of , is this really what we want to do? And normally I'd be , hell yes, but I'm kind of not feeling it. And that's really disorienting. Yeah. Eric, how do clarity for yourself? When you're clear on something, what's the experience that you're having? Yeah. I mean, it's a great question. I think it's, I just feel the sense of flow, ? It's the sense of just real knowing. It's really intangible. Yeah. For instance, when I signed up for this course, I knew it away, ? I mean, it was just , not even a question. And I kind of don't have that around this. And I don't know why. Yeah. And where do you feel the flow? what part of your being does that come from? Yeah. I mean, I kind of physically feel it in my forehead. But in terms of the being, I think it's just hard to explain. It's really just a knowing, ? It's just this, it's just really clear. It's this clear knowing that's really black and white. it's just certainty. It's , I will be doing that. Yeah. And of all the things in the world, this should be the most certain. , I mean, to make a long story short, this is . Yeah. It's big. It's a lot wrapped up in this, ? Yeah. And I just, and I don't know whether I'm just being lazy or it's the money, or maybe I'm worried that I pumped it up too much in my mind. And it just, I just, but I just kind of feeling it. And I don't know why. What have you been tapping into thus far in grasping for that clarity? Yeah. I mean, I think, , for many years, , , I came back to the States and, , I was very disoriented and , I could make them tell you a lot of stories. . But I mean, it's , and this was a while ago, this was, , until I was about maybe mid twenties, 30, maybe. And, and it was, , , that was the, , everything was , nothing's as good as there. . It was very , nothing's as good as there. Nobody understands. Nobody is, I mean, this is gets really sort of arrogant, ? nobody's has traveled as much as I have. . I worked, I used to work for a lady and she was the first person I met who traveled more than I had. And, but I was , , nobody's traveled as much. Nobody can understand.

And, and it was, , , that was the, , everything was , nothing's as good as there. . It was very , nothing's as good as there. Nobody understands. Nobody is, I mean, this is gets really sort of arrogant, ? nobody's has traveled as much as I have. . I worked, I used to work for a lady and she was the first person I met who traveled more than I had. And, but I was , , nobody's traveled as much. Nobody can understand. I can't really relate to people. And, and I sort of got, I sort of overcame that. It's just when I got married and had kids, I was , , this is legit. . this stuff here, it counts. And, and it's just really disorienting to be , well, shouldn't that old stuff matter? , and it sort of feels almost I'm betraying, I'm dishonoring it somehow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What meaning are you making around this trip? Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. I knew this shit was going to happen. Sorry. I think it's. Sorry. this is kind of the closest place I have to home geographically. Yeah. Other than my family, which is also home. And it's, and it's this, this kind of tug of war between those two. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe my real home is not my family as opposed to this place that I haven't been to in 30 years. And , maybe I don't need to go there. Yeah. Not sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. I'm appreciating. Yeah. The enormity of this. This is. Yeah. This is bigger than making a decision on a family vacation, ? Yeah. I guess . I just.

Oh, sorry. And , , , that's thrown in there too. And I'm . But, , maybe it's OK, maybe. , maybe I'm giving it too much meaning. I'm just not sure. Not sure. Yeah. What values are you wrestling with as you think about go, not to go? Yeah. Great question. I mean, I think part of it is , I'm not a big, , I sort of to take risks. . , I'm a bit , I to at least think of myself as somebody who, , if it's , if it's , if it's actor, not act I err on the side of act always, even if it's scary. , part of me is , wow, that's really sort of off brand to , not go. , of course, why? I mean, you go. And and then the other side of it is , , I, I don't know if I'm is , , I want to do what's best for my family. And I, and while they get a ton out of it, it's a super long trip. , it's really expensive. I mean, we'd be . But, , , would they have more fun doing something else? Would they learn more doing something else? And it's this sort of allegiance and responsibility to all this past stuff. It's maybe just relevant to me versus or not even .

VC12.txt,"a real should going on and I hate that word. . But there's a real should going on. Yeah. And it's a puzzling. Yeah. Sorry. Please. Oh, no. Shoulds and maybes. Yeah. Babies. Yeah. And you just, you just expressed how you're, you're, , my experience of what you said were your MO is decisive risk-taking. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. What has you curious about the shoulds and maybes in this decision? Yeah, no, thank you for that. I mean, I think it's, it's puzzling that I'm not , just go. , that's puzzling to me that. I don't have that. And I'm wondering if maybe I've got it backwards. And this is weird for me to think about. But , maybe, maybe the risky thing to do or the edgy thing to do is to not go. Is to be , fuck it. I, and that's just, it's backwards and surprising and unexpected. Because I'm really kind of not feeling it. I mean, I was thinking about it all day today. I was , , I should be more. I was going to use excitement as a compass. ? , that's sort of how sometimes how I to live. , I'm excited about it. , that's a sign that that's a thing. And I'm just not feeling it's , and I don't think my compass is broken. And it's just, I mean, if I was going to follow my intuition, my intuition is kind of saying no. And I just, and maybe it's, , it's , I don't know. I mean, it's, it would really be trusting that intuition because everything logical says, dude, are you crazy? Of course you go. you've been planning this, before you even got married and had a family, ? And it's just, it's just puzzling. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Who else sits on your internal board of advisors? You said excitement, intuition. Oh God. Yeah. Alexander's listening to this. He'll this. I've got this, I've got this, if we talk in terms of parts work, . I got this guy called the judge and the judge is Venom, Spider-Man, the guy in black, , he's scary and got claws and stuff. And he's, and he's, the judge says a lot of stuff. And of course, when I tell the judge to settle down, he turns into the guys from the Muppet show, the guys in the balconies, , he said stuff, but it's, it's harmless. And , maybe that's that guy in terms of board of directors, who's there saying who's judge is sitting in judgment thinking, well, maybe, , of course you're going to go, it'd be treasonous not to go. It'd be heretical not to go. Cause he's really old. The judge is old. I mean, and he, he probably remembers the time I lived in Asia. Yeah. I hadn't really thought of that. Anything you want to ask or say to the judge? No, he's really fucking scary. He's really scary. Really scary. I mean, I suppose I could say that maybe that part just needs reassurance. That by not going, it doesn't, it doesn't have to mean anything, , it doesn't have to, it doesn't have to mean anything more than I make it. It doesn't have to mean that I'm selling out or I'm being too tame or I'm not being, , I'm playing it safe. Oh, I fucking hate that. Playing it saves the worst. . maybe, maybe it's that part that's judging me for doing that, for playing it safe. Cause I almost feel I'd be going now that I think I almost feel I'd be going into , please, please somebody. And, and I don't know who that would be other than myself. , yeah. Eric, if you decided not to go, what would you want to make it mean? What would you choose to make it mean? Well, I think it would be, it would be a real sign of letting that go. I mean, there's a lot of old stuff, just letting that go. just letting that go. that doesn't have to be my North star. there can be other things that, , are as cool as that.
