v 13.11 | © 2020 International Coaching Federation                  ICF Team Coaching Competencies:  Moving Beyond One-to-One Coaching    Introduction  Due to the desire for teams to perform well, consistently and over a long period of time, ongoing  team development is necessary. As a result, team coaching is growing rapidly. Team coaching is an  experience that allows a team to work towards sustainable results and ongoing development. It is  becoming an increasingly important intervention in corporate environments as high team performance  requires aligning toward goals, remaining innovative, and adapting quickly to internal and external  changes. Team coaching exists under this umbrella of team development, along with the following  modalities: team building, team training, team consulting, team mentoring, team facilitation, and team  coaching. These modalities are further compared in Figure 1.  To develop a set of team coaching competencies, ICF designed a rigorous, evidence-based  research project. The aim of this study was to determine which Knowledge, Skills, Abilities, and Other  characteristics (KSAO) team coaches use in addition to the ICF Core Competencies. The following  activities were undertaken:    •  A comprehensive literature review,  •  Development of team coaching critical incidents,  •  Task, and KSAO virtual workshops to garner an understanding of the experience of team coaching  and how it differs from one-to-one coaching,  •  Semi-structured interviews to understand how team coaches experience coaching engagements  and what team coaching means to them as a profession,  •  A global survey to determine the importance of specific team coaching tasks and KSAOs and  their  relationship to facilitation, and  •  Competency model workshops to review all of the job analysis data.  v 13.11 | © 2020 International Coaching Federation      Caution should be applied when considering integrating team coaching with team training,  consulting, or mentoring. These three modalities are quite directive and therefore distinct from team  coaching. Some team coaches feel that these three modalities should not be undertaken by the team  coach, since doing so may cause confusion with the team and inhibit the coach’s ability to function  well as a coach. Nevertheless, from the data, it is clear that team coaches frequently wander into  facilitation mode in order to promote dialogue amongst the team members. Facilitation is about  enhancing communication and achieving clarity; the work remains on the surface and does not delve  into an analysis of the team dynamics. Team coaching goes deeper than facilitation—exploring the  subsurface dynamics of individual team member personalities, sub-groups, and how they might affect  team performance. There may not be a crisp distinction between team coaching and facilitation.  Rather, there may be a continuum between facilitation and coaching, and a good team coach may work  seamlessly anywhere along this continuum.  Because team coaching is multi-faceted, team coaches must also have a significantly broader  knowledge base when working with teams than with individuals. They need to have an understanding  of how to identify and resolve conflict, recognize power dynamics within the team, understand what  is required for high performing teams, know how to build team cohesion, develop rules and norms,  encourage participation and contribution by all, and promote team autonomy and sustainability. In  individual, one-to-one coaching, coaches are frequently careful when shifting to a modality other  than coaching. In team coaching, that distinction between the various modalities may not be so  apparent. It is up to the individual coach to decide how much information to share regarding the  different modalities with the client. Due to the complexity of team dynamics and factors that affect their  performance, team coaches often must be more directive than when working with clients one-to-one.  Supervision is also more important for team coaches due to the complexity of the work and ease with  which a team coach can get mired in internal team dynamics.  v 13.11 | © 2020 International Coaching Federation      Figure 1. Team development modalities      Team coaches may use additional modalities beyond coaching when necessary. This may be done overtly or discreetly.  v 13.11 | © 2020 International Coaching Federation      ICF Team Coaching Competencies:  Extending the  Core Competencies Framework  This document provides the additional knowledge and skills a professional coach must have to  effectively engage in team coaching practice, which ICF defines as partnering in a co-creative and  reflective process with a team and its dynamics and relationships in a way that inspires them to  maximize their abilities and potential in order to reach their common purpose and shared goals.  The ICF Team Coaching Competencies support a team coach practitioner in understanding the  distinct knowledge, skills, and tasks required for working with teams. At the core of this practice,  however, remains the ICF Core Competencies, which provide the foundation for all coaching practice.  Each element of the ICF Team Coaching Competency model is organized in alignment with the  structure of the ICF Core Competencies. Reference is made to the ICF Core Competency or sub-  competency, along with guidance on any contextual nuances, dynamics, or additions necessary for  team coaching practice. While no new competencies are required for team coaching beyond the eight  ICF Core Competencies, several new sub-competencies are necessary to be effective team coach  practitioners. The following table provides the additions for team coaching, those required beyond the  ICF Core Competency Model.  A critical distinction between the ICF Core Competencies and the ICF Team Coaching Competencies  is the nature of the client. While the use of the term “client” in the ICF Core Competencies often  represents an individual, the client in a team coaching context is a team as a single entity, comprising  multiple individuals. When applied alongside the Team Coaching Competencies in a team coaching  context, however, the term “client” in the Core Competencies represents the team, rather than an  individual.  The following pages will break down each of the Team Coaching Competencies as they relate to the  ICF Core Competencies—first by sharing the background of each competency, and second by showing  a visual representation of how the two competency models work together.  v 13.11 | © 2020 International Coaching Federation      Competency 1: Demonstrates Ethical Practice  Definition: Understands and consistently applies coaching ethics and standards of coaching.      ICF Team Coaching Competency  Supplements to the ICF Core  Competencies  Background  + Coaches the client team as a single entity  The client for a team coach is the team as a  single entity. A team is made up of individual  team members and each one must be heard  and play an integral role in team discussions.  Further, the team coach must remain objective  in all interactions with team members, sponsors,  and relevant stakeholders. The team coach  should not be perceived as taking sides with  any subgroups or individual members of the  team, should remain open to what is emerging  in the sessions, and should be completely  honest in all dealings with the team. Discussions  with individual team members will need to  remain confidential to the team coach and  team member unless the team member allows  disclosure of information to others and as per  the team coaching agreement.  + Maintains the distinction between team  coaching, team building, team training, team  consulting, team mentoring, team facilitation,  and other team development modalities  Team development can involve many  modalities, including team coaching, team  building, team training, team consulting, team  mentoring, and team facilitation. The team  coach should partner with other experts when  the demands of a specific team coaching  engagement warrant or when specific  knowledge and skill levels are required. While  the distinction between these modalities may  not always need to be highlighted, caution must  be applied if interventions beyond coaching  are undertaken. Team coaches may need to  refer clients to many types of professionals  and also receive assistance from a co-coach,  a supervisor, or other team development  professionals.  + Demonstrates the knowledge and skill  needed to practice the specific blend of team  development modalities that are being offered  A team coach is sufficiently skilled to  competently practice all of the team  development modalities that the team  coach is offering as part of a team coaching  engagement.  v 13.11 | © 2020 International Coaching Federation      ICF Team Coaching Competency  Supplements to the ICF Core  Competencies  Background  + Adopts more directive team development  modalities only when needed to help the team  achieve their goals  In general, there are more times when a team  coach will need to be directive than when  working with a client on a one-to-one basis.  These instances, however, should remain  limited to those opportunities that require  a directive approach to bring awareness to  growth areas for the team and to help them  understand the team coaching process. They  may be critical moments in team coaching  sessions, pointing out positive and negative  team dynamics, and introducing ways to move  forward. These moments of being directive  should broaden, rather than narrow, the team’s  perspective on their current situation.  + Maintains trust, transparency, and clarity when  fulfilling multiple roles related to team coaching  In the event that a team coach offers multiple  team development modalities, the coach must  be clear about these different roles and how  one role may affect another.        Integrating the ICF Core and Team Coaching Competencies:  Demonstrates Ethical Practice    1.  Demonstrates personal integrity and honesty  in interactions with clients, sponsors and  relevant stakeholders  2.

ICF Team Coaching Competency  Supplements to the ICF Core  Competencies  Background  + Engages in coaching supervision for support,  development, and accountability when needed  It could be easy for a team coach to become  entangled in the team dynamics and become  unaware of issues that should be addressed.  Because of this, team coaches should be  working with a coaching supervisor. Team  coaching can be much more intense than  one-to-one coaching given the input from  many team members at once. Supervision  uses reflection on past events, awareness of  the coach’s part in those past moments or the  present moment, and the effect it has on the  coach’s behavior. A supervisor is an excellent  resource for a team coach as an impartial  observer and aid to the reflective practice and  its part in the team coaching process.  + Remains objective and aware of team  dynamics and patterns  Teams are made up of individuals who have  unique personalities, knowledge, skills,  and motivations. The combination of these  individuals working together will bring about  many dynamics of power, control, expertise, and  disparate goals. The team coach must be aware  of and alert to how these dynamics might play  out in team interactions, the team’s agenda,  internal disputes, beliefs, alliances, and must  remain objective at all times.  v 13.11 | © 2020 International Coaching Federation      Integrating the ICF Core and Team Coaching Competencies:  Embodies a Coaching Mindset    1.

Establishes agreements for the overall coaching  engagement as well as those for each coaching session.    ICF Team Coaching Competency  Supplements to the ICF Core  Competencies  Background  + Explains what team coaching is and is  not, including how it differs from other team  development modalities  It is important for the team coach to highlight  the difference between team coaching and  other team development modalities. Given  the unique nature of individuals’ personalities,  teams may need to be very intentional about  the process to determine team and team coach  compatibility.  + Partners with all relevant parties, including the  team leader, team members, stakeholders, and  any co-coaches to collaboratively create clear  agreements about the coaching relationship,  processes, plans, development modalities, and  goals  The team coaching agreement must be  agreeable to all parties, including the individual  team members and the co-coach, when working  with one, as well as sponsors, as appropriate.  Confidentiality regarding what takes place in  team coaching sessions should be addressed,  as well as private discussions between the team  coach and individual team members. It is also  important to consider the role and extent to  which the organization’s culture, mission, and  overall context influences the team coaching  engagement.  + Partners with the team leader to determine  how ownership of the coaching process will be  shared among the coach, leader, and team  One of the purposes of team coaching is to  help build a sustainable team that does not  require the presence of the coach to maintain  forward momentum. While the team coaching  process may initially be directed by the coach,  agreement should be reached as to how the  ownership is gradually turned over to the team  leader and the team as a collective.  v 13.11 | © 2020 International Coaching Federation      Integrating the ICF Core and Team Coaching Competencies:  Establishes and Maintains Agreements            1.

Maintains a relationship of mutual respect and trust.    ICF Team Coaching Competency  Supplements to the ICF Core  Competencies  Background  + Creates and maintains a safe space for open  and honest team member interaction  In order for each team member to participate  freely and meaningfully, the team coach must  build a safe space within which each team  member feels free to disagree with teammates  or raise sensitive topics. When working with  an individual client, the coach is aware and  respectful of the client’s cultural context. In team  coaching the team may have its own culture,  which is a variant of the organization’s culture  and may add an additional layer of complexity  to the engagement.  + Promotes the team viewing itself as a single  entity with a common identity  An element of team sustainability is the  perspective of each member that the team is  a single, high-performing unit. The team coach  should consistently promote team identity and  self-sufficiency.  + Fosters expression of individual team  members’ and the collective team’s feelings,  perceptions, concerns, beliefs, hopes, and  suggestions  The team coach may need to encourage team  members to speak freely in team meetings to  share their individual feelings, perceptions,  concerns, beliefs, hopes, and suggestions. It  is also important for the coach to understand  and clarify the collective feelings, perceptions,  concerns, beliefs, and hopes of the team.  + Encourages participation and contribution by  all team members  It is important to get the full benefit from the  knowledge and skill of each team member.  + Partners with the team to develop, maintain,  and reflect on team rules and norms  Rules and norms can help teams to be more  productive and perform at a higher level.  Clarification and codification of these rules and  norms can also help a team to be more self-  sustainable.  v 13.11 | © 2020 International Coaching Federation      ICF Team Coaching Competency  Supplements to the ICF Core  Competencies  Background  + Promotes effective communication within the  team  Good communication amongst team members  can often be challenging, however, a good  flow of information is vital to team success. The  team coach should ensure that communication  from individual members of the team is  directed to the team and consistently redirects  communication within the team when it is  directed to the coach.  + Partners with the team to identify and resolve  internal conflict  It is inevitable that there will be some conflict  within every team. It is important to bring all  conflict to the surface and deal with it in a  constructive manner that promotes learning and  growth.

ICF Team Coaching Competency  Supplements to the ICF Core  Competencies  Background  + Uses one’s full range of sensory and  perceptual abilities to focus on what is  important to the coaching process  The team coach will often be overloaded  with information, necessitating full sensory  awareness and perception of what is  happening in the room throughout the coaching  engagement.  + Uses a co-coach when agreed to by the team  and sponsors and when doing so will allow the  team coach to be more present in the team  coaching session  Working with a co-coach can take pressure off  the singular team coach, given the significant  amount of information emerging during team  coaching sessions. A co-coach can help to  observe team dynamics, team and individual  behavior patterns, provide alternative  perspectives, and model team behavior.  + Encourages team members to pause and  reflect how they are interacting in team  coaching sessions  Encouraging team members to pause and  reflect begins the reflective practice work  for a team. The team coach can then follow  through with raising awareness of their own  actions, subsequent behaviors, and potential  improvements in the moment or in future team  interactions.  + Moves in and out of the team dialogue as  appropriate  Since one of the objectives of team coaching  is for the team to become self-sufficient, the  team coach should enter into the dialogue only  as necessary to enhance the team process  and performance. The team coach should be  present for the team as a whole and at the  same time for each individual. This can be a  challenge at moments of high intensity and  when many team members are involved.  v 13.11 | © 2020 International Coaching Federation      Integrating the ICF Core and Team Coaching Competencies:  Maintains Presence    1.

ICF Team Coaching Competency  Supplements to the ICF Core  Competencies  Background  + Notices how the perspectives shared by each  team member relate to other team members’  views and the team dialogue  It is important for team members to listen and  communicate well for shared understanding  and subsequent high performance. Exploring  below the surface of what is being said often  allows a deeper meaning and understanding  to emerge. This can help to resolve conflict  and enhance innovation and problem-solving  sessions.  + Notices how each team member impacts the  collective team energy, engagement, and focus  A team coach can greatly enhance team  performance by bringing to light individual team  member behaviors that add to and take away  from team momentum, engagement, creativity,  and focus.  + Notices verbal and non-verbal communication  patterns among team members to identify  potential alliances, conflicts, and growth  opportunities  Observing, understanding, and enhancing  team dynamics may be significant factors in  improving team performance. Team coaches  must be able to observe the subtlety of team  dynamics evident from verbal and non-verbal  communication.  + Models confident, effective communication  and collaboration when working with a co-  coach or other experts  Fluid communication amongst team members is  essential for high performance. Team coaches  can model this behavior when working with a  co-coach and other experts.  + Encourages the team to own the dialogue  Team members may tend to direct  communication to the team coach, especially at  the beginning of team coaching engagements.  In order to enhance sustainability, team coaches  should consistently turn the dialogue inward,  back to the team. Making choices as a team  can be complex. Data may need to come from  many team members, bringing the elements  of trust and expertise into play. The team must  decide how to process data and how to make  decisions. Although helping a team to work  through such issues may be more aligned  with team facilitation, the process of getting  the team to become self-sufficient is a team  coaching function.  v 13.11 | © 2020 International Coaching Federation      Integrating the ICF Core and Team Coaching Competencies:  Listens Actively            1.
