About the Authors

Part I
Setting the Scene
Introduction
This initial part comprises four chapters which are intended to set the scene and
provide an introduction and context for the rest of this book.
Chapter 1 addresses the topic of coaching maturity and begins by describing some
of the steps a coach can take toward becoming a qualiﬁed coach by engaging in
accredited training and progressing toward a credential from the International
Coaching Federation (ICF). We also position that these steps are not just a means
to an end and that in fact there is no end to the level of experience and maturity a
person can seek and gain over time. In this way, we propose that maturity is an
ongoing and lifelong journey of development and growth.
In Chap. 2 we look at the deﬁnition of coaching. Firstly, we describe the reasons
why having clarity of the deﬁnition of this way of working and communicating is
important. We also note that several deﬁnitions exist and share with you some
examples which highlight foundational themes and similarities, alongside slight
nuances and distinctions in each case. This chapter also looks at some of the
differences between coaching and other ways of working and other professional
services available to clients. We start with the coaching and mentoring continuum as
these two modalities are often confused and intertwined. We explore the differences
between these ways of working further in Chap. 31. The coaching-therapy and
coaching-consultancy relationships are also outlined.
In Chaps. 3 and 4 we look respectively at who we are and who are our clients. The
inquiry into who we are looks at the concept and beneﬁts of self-awareness and self-
reﬂection (an area that is also explored in Chap. 30). We position the MBTI model as
one of the many lenses we can use to gain insight into ourselves. Furthermore, we
emphasize the importance of self-awareness and how it is highlighted within the ICF
Core Competency Model. Finally, we offer some suggestions for tools and
approaches that coaches can use as reﬂective practices to enhance their self-
awareness as they develop on their own journey toward increased coaching maturity.

The ﬁnal chapter of this part offers reﬂections on what is the coaching mindset we
hold with regard to our clients. Once again, the idea of lenses is highlighted, and we
share several examples of tools we can use to help shape and develop our coaching
mindset so that we engage with our clients from a positive vs. deﬁcit perspective. We
note that such tools are not only useful for the coach; they may also provide powerful
windows for our clients to “see” themselves, thus enhancing their own self-
awareness as part of the coaching process.

Chapter 1
The Journey Toward Maturity
Introduction
There is much discussion in professional coaching circles about coach development.
The ICF have their own terms for the journey a coach takes in their development
from student to associate credentialed coach (ACC) to professional credentialed
coach (PCC) and ﬁnally to master coach (MCC). In this book we have focused our
thinking around the term ‘maturity’ as an alternative way of thinking about coach
development, recognizing that many high performing coaches may not yet be a
MCC. In this chapter we introduce the idea of maturity. We suggest that coach
development is a continual process, not a destination, and that even for the MCC,
development continues. We are all on a developmental journey.
Coaching Maturity
As with all professions there are levels of competence or skill. As a new ICF coach
your journey may have started when you ﬁrst received coaching from a colleague at
work, or through a professional coach. This may have got you interested in the
power of coaching, and its potential to help you discover for yourself the best options
for you. Or you may have decided to attend a short coaching skills course. This
engaged your curiosity. Whatever way it may be, you have decided to become a
coach. You have formally started on your journey of development.
However, completing a formal training program, ASCTH (Approved Speciﬁc
Coach Training Hours) or ACTP (Approved Coach Training Program), is only part
of the journey. To become an ICF credentialed coach, there are other aspects to
complete including:

4. Coaching assessment
You may currently be on that journey now, or you may already be an ICF ACC or
a PCC. In fact, you may already be a Master Credential Coach (MCC) who is keen to
continue to extend your learning. Or you may be someone who has practiced
coaching for years but has never got a formal coaching qualiﬁcation.
Whichever it is, the journey toward maturity does not stop at any of these points.
We have used the phrase ‘maturity’, as opposed to ‘mastery’, as mastery can imply
an ending: We become a ‘master’ as a result of years of training and practice. In
contrast the phrase ‘maturity’ implies an inﬁnite process, where development never
stops. We can always become more mature, more reﬂective and more insightful
about our practice.
In fact, we would suggest that the coach who stops learning, is the coach who is
ready to stop coaching. Coaching requires us to remain curious about our clients and
ourselves, to see our clients as having the capacity to learn and change and role-
modelling this belief in our own behaviors, as a learner and someone open and ready
to learn and adapt to clients and the dynamic world in which we work.
In this book we aim to offer multiple ways to continue to develop, from a focus on
coaching competencies, coaching models, coaching practice and ultimately eclecti-
cism and integration.

The Journey Toward Maturity

The framework, informed by the work of David Clutterbuck and David
Megginson (Clutterbuck and Megginson, undated), shows several levels toward
coach maturity, we feel there may even be a level beyond what is shown here,
which could be the transcendence of the illusion of models.
Most coaches go through a series of common experiences as illustrated in Box
1.1, starting with a focus on Models: “How do I apply my model with this client?”
This is followed by a focus on tools “How do I apply these tools with this client?”
and onwards through to a philosophical approach, where the coach assumes people
are similar to them, and toward an integrated approach. In reaching the integrated
position the coach aims to draw from a multicity of perspectives, employs a multiple
frameworks, models and tools, without becoming obsessed with any of them, and
take into account systemic factors, adapting, ﬂexing and partnering with their client,
without vested interest or ego to help the client move forward.
Here are some of the changes that you might experience on your journey of
personal development
•
From a narrow perspective that a single coaching models is best, often the one
you were taught on the program, toward a broader perspective that different
people may learn and change in different ways
•
From a need for certainties, and a search for a perfect solution, to enjoying the
journey of coaching, with its uncertainties and ambiguity, and allowing whatever
emerges to emerge.
•
From a focus on solving the client’s current problem, toward a focus on helping
the client develop greater self-awareness and personal responsibility
•
From a performance orientation and a focus on doing, to a presence orientation
with a focus on being
•
From preoccupation with either the self or the client, to a focus on the relation-
ships between yourself, the client and the client’s systems
•
From a focus on the conversation to a focus on the relationship
Where are you on your own journey? You may like to reﬂect on these questions.
Of course, a series of questions such as these in a book is only a rough guide.
What is more important is to start thinking about these elements and explore what
your next steps might be in your own developmental journey. We hope this book
will offer a useful resource for you: understanding the ICF Competencies, how to
apply them in your coaching practice, reﬂecting on your wider practice as a coach
and recognizing your development is to a journey not a destination.
Conclusion
In this chapter we suggested all coaches, whether they are novices, professionals
or masters, are on a personal journey of development. We have argued that instead of
a focus on a speciﬁc stage—ACC, PCC or MCC, it may be more helpful for all
coaches to see development as journey of continuous improvement and growth.

Chapter 2
What Is Coaching?
Coaching Deﬁned
Since coaching started its development as a separate discipline in the early 1980s
(Brock, 2012; Passmore & Theeboom, 2016) deﬁnitions of coaching have been part
of the debate within coaching practice and research. Almost every book, article and
blog has offered a viewpoint as to ‘what is coaching?’
The search for a formal deﬁnition of coaching may be considered to be an
academic pursuit by many practitioners. However, we believe there are at least
three reasons why thinking about ‘what is coaching’ is important.
First, a clear deﬁnition is essential for coaching practice. A standardized deﬁni-
tion makes it clear to clients what they can expect from a coach, and that we are all
delivering the same service.
Second, a deﬁnition of coaching is vital for research. We need to clearly delineate
the domain of coaching to understand the phenomena being studied. As coaching is
still an emerging research domain, it is crucial to deﬁne the key components to
differentiate coaching from other similar helping interventions (e.g. counseling or
consulting) and provides a platform from which theoretical contributions can
develop.
Third, a consistent deﬁnition is vital for coach education and qualiﬁcations. A
shared understand of what we do, enables us to develop a shared body of knowledge
and an agreed standard for training, with a scientiﬁc-based framework to support its
pedagogy.
The ICF holds a similar view and has provided a clear deﬁnition of coaching:
Coaching is partnering with clients in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires
them to maximize their personal and professional potential.

Alternative Deﬁnitions
The reality is there are host of deﬁnitions used by different writers, reﬂecting
different nuances placed by the writers, researchers and practitioners on different
aspects of their work. We have included in Box 2.1 ten different deﬁnitions to
compare and contrast with the ICF deﬁnition. Only by thinking about how others
deﬁne coaching can we fully understand the nature and boundaries of our practice.
John Whitmore, widely credited as one of the founding thinkers of coaching,
placed a marker in the sand in his seminal book Coaching for Performance. For
Whitmore, coaching was about “unlocking a person’s potential to maximize their
own performance. It is helping them to learn rather than teaching them—a facilita-
tion approach” (Whitmore, 1992, p. 8).
Whitmore drew heavily on Timothy Gallwey’s book about the inner game.
Gallwey (1986) had noted in sport performance that the internal state of a player
was a signiﬁcant factor. He went further to argue that it was more signiﬁcant even
than the opponent in individual sports like tennis and golf. If the individual could
control their self-talk, sizable performance gains could be made. At the core of
coaching for John Whitmore was a belief that the purpose of coaching was helping
individuals develop greater self-awareness and personal responsibility and through
this awareness and responsibility, performance could be improved: “Performance
coaching is based on awareness and responsibility” (Whitmore, 1992, p. 173).
Other founding writers offered alternative deﬁnitions. Laura Whitworth was one
of the pioneers in the US, along with Thomas Leonard (Brock, 2009). Whitworth
developed co-active coaching which she deﬁned as “a relationship of possibilities . . .
based on trust, conﬁdentiality.” (Whitworth, Kinsey-House, & Sandahl, 1998)
These deﬁnitions highlight the nature of the coaching process and its dependency
on people, interpersonal interactions and collaboration. This relational aspect distin-
guishes coaching from other training interventions, where arguably knowledge
exchange is at the heart of the process.
Jonathan Passmore and Annette Fillery-Travis have adopted a process-based
deﬁnition in an attempt to differentiate coaching from mentoring, counseling and
other conversation-based approaches to change, while linking the concept to John
Whitmore’s fundamental purpose of coaching; self-awareness and personal respon-
sibility. They deﬁne coaching as “a Socratic based dialogue between a facilitator
(coach) and a participant (client) where the majority of interventions used by the
facilitator are open questions which are aimed at stimulating the self-awareness and
personal responsibility of the client” (Passmore & Fillery-Travis, 2011).
Tatiana Bachkirova, a leading UK coaching academic, suggests that coaching is
“a human development process that involves structured, focused interaction and the
use of appropriate strategies, tools and techniques to promote desirable and sustain-
able change for the beneﬁt of the coachee. . .” (Bachkirova et al., 2010, p. 1). While
Lai (2014) states that coaching is a “reﬂective process between coaches and coachees
which helps or facilitates coachees to experience positive behavioral changes
through continuous dialogue and negotiations with coaches to meet coachees’

personal or work goals”. Again, positive behavioral changes are highlighted as the
main purpose of coaching, with the recognition that a structured process is involved.
Moreover, “negotiation” is put forward in Lai’s reinterpretation of coaching that
reﬂects the previous deﬁnitions, coaching is a relationship-based learning and
development process.
The deﬁnitions offer the reader a diversity of perspectives, while retaining the
essence of the ICF deﬁnition of a collaborative, non-directive process between a
coach and client.
Box 2.1 Deﬁnitions of Coaching
1. “Coaching is directly concerned with the immediate improvement of
performance and development of skills by a form of tutoring or instruc-
tion.” (Parsloe, 1992)
2. “Unlocking a person’s potential to maximize their own performance. It is
helping them to learn rather than teaching them.” (Whitmore, 1992)
3. “A collaborative, solution focused, result-orientated and systematic pro-
cess in which the coach facilitates the enhancement of work performance,
life experience, self-directed learning and person growth of the coachee.”
(Grant, 2001)
4. “The art of facilitating the performance, learning and development of
another.” (Downey, 1993)
5. [Co-active] coaching is “a powerful alliance designed to forward and
enhance a life-long process of human learning, effectiveness and fulﬁl-
ment.” (Whitworth et al., 1998)
6. “Psychological skills and methods are employed in a one-on-one relation-
ship to help someone become a more effective manager or leader. These
skills are typically applied to a speciﬁc present-moment work-related
issues . . . in a way that enable this client to incorporate them into his or
her permanent management or leadership repertoire.” (Peltier, 2010)
7. “A Socratic based dialogue between a facilitator (coach) and a participant
(client) where the majority of interventions used by the facilitator are open
questions which are aimed at stimulating the self-awareness and personal
responsibility of the participant” (Passmore and Fillery-Travis, 2011).
8. A “reﬂective process between coaches and coachees which helps or
facilitates coachees to experience positive behavioural changes through
continuous dialogue and negotiations with coaches to meet coachees’
personal or work goals.” (Lai, 2014)
9. “A helping relationship formed between a client who has managerial
authority and responsibility in an organization and a consultant who
uses a wide variety of behavioural techniques and methods to help the
client achieve a mutually identiﬁed set of goals to improve his or her
professional performance and personal satisfaction and, consequently, to

improve the effectiveness of the client’s organization within a formally
deﬁned coaching agreement.” (Kilburg, 1996, p 142)
10. “A human development process that involves structured, focused interac-
tion and the use of appropriate strategies, tools and techniques to promote
desirable and sustainable change for the beneﬁt of the coachee.. . .”
(Bachkirova et al., 2010, p. 1)
Coaching and Mentoring
Coaching and mentoring are often considered to sit on a continuum. Both coaching
and mentoring are concerned with personal and professional development, but the
amount of input by the coach-mentor increases as one moves along the continuum
toward mentoring (Fig. 2.1).
In this sense, mentoring may be better regarded as a form of tutelage, where a
more senior, or experienced, mentor shares their knowledge and insights with a more
junior or less experienced mentee about how to improve in a speciﬁc job, role,
vocation or organization.
Some writers have suggested workplace mentoring involves a relationship
between a less experienced individual (protégé) and a more experienced person
(the mentor), where the purpose is the personal and professional growth of the
protégé (Eby, Rhodes, & Allen, 2007, p. 16). The mentor may be a peer at work, a
supervisor, someone else within the organization, but someone who is outside of the
protégé’s chain of command. Others have argued that coaching also differs from
mentoring in its use of structured processes, such as the use of coaching models like
GROW, and the use of speciﬁc tools and assessments, to provide awareness in the
client (Joo, 2005).
A further difference is the length of the relationship. While coaching assignments
are more frequently completed in several months, mentoring relationships often
continue over several years (Passmore, 2016).
Finally, in terms of purpose, while the main purpose of workplace coaching is
considered to be on improving performance or wellbeing through self-awareness and
learning, the purpose of mentoring varies widely from socialization of newcomers to
management development (Joo, 2005).
Coaches need to be cautious not to be drawn in to mentoring relationships when
they have contracted to deliver coaching. Speciﬁcally, coaches should be wary of

being drawn into a long-term relationship, where the coach creates a dependency in
the client, leading to a coaching relationship than continues for years not months.
There is nothing wrong with such a relationship, but in our view, this is more likely
to be mentoring rather than coaching.
A second danger for coaches is being drawn into providing advice. Less experi-
enced managers may request this from their coach and less experienced coaches may
fall back on past behaviors, sharing their experience or knowledge, as ‘this is what
you should do. . .’ advice to their clients. Again, we would see this as mentoring, not
coaching.
These styles of engagement can be immensely useful for senior executives, who
value having a trusted advisor available to them, talking through regularly their
issues and problems, gathering their views and using them as a guide.
Coaching and Therapy
Understanding the difference between therapy or counseling and coaching is impor-
tant for both coaches and for clients. Clients can sometimes end up in coaching when
they really need help from a trained therapist for a clinical condition. At the same
time coaches can be drawn into talking about issues outside of their area of
knowledge and training.
The need for a clearer differentiation between counseling/therapy and coaching is
emerging as the use of psychological models and tools in coaching interventions has
increased (Bachkirova, 2008). Such a differentiation is essential to ensure the coach
remains within their area of competence and within the terms of their contract.
The similarities between the counseling/therapy and coaching domains are
numerous. Both are concerned with the ‘relationship’. They both recognize the
need for engagement or ‘client’s commitment’ to the process, both rely on the
‘practitioner’s (coach’s) self-awareness’ to facilitate change, both recognize the
need to keep the conversation moving forward. In addition, both counseling/therapy
and coaching share a number of basic required professional skills such as listening,
presence, trust and evoking awareness.
However, we suggest that there are at least three differentiating aspects. First, the
initial motivation of clients to undertake counseling/therapy is different from
coaching. For example, the individual usually expects to eliminate psychological
problems and dysfunctions through counseling/therapy sessions. In this sense it may
be considered to be primarily problem focused. In contrast coaching clients are
seeking something different. The coaching client arrives in anticipation of an
improvement in personal and professional development. In this sense it may be
considered to be solution focused.
Second, the focus of counseling/therapy may involve any matters relevant to the
client’s mental wellbeing, while the coaching process is usually restricted to the
agreed and contracted goals. The expected outcomes and evaluation methods are
Coaching and Therapy
11

usually deﬁned prior to the ﬁrst session with the involved parties (e.g. clients,
supervisors and other stakeholders).
Third, the time horizon for the work is longer. While the coach may contract for
4, 6 or possibly 12 sessions, the therapists, contracts week by week, with a view that
the relationship takes as long as it takes. In many cases a counseling relationship will
continue for a year, and sometimes for many years.
Coaches need to be wary when working with clients who may be presenting with
clinical conditions. Such clients should be referred to their medical doctor or a
therapist before starting a relationship. Coaches also need to be careful not to be
drawn into extending their work into these areas, for example a workload priority
discussion extending into workplace stress, which extends into feelings of distress,
anxiety or depression, and a revelation that the client is taking medication as a result
of clinical condition. Once again coaches need to be clear during the contracting
phases what coaching includes, and where non-coaching themes emerge for these
discussions to be signposted to the appropriate trained professionals. Additional
guidance and resource references on this can be found in Chap. 6.
Coaching and Consulting
The ﬁnal area of confusion can be with consulting. Like mentoring, consulting has
an advice or input element. Coaches while engaged by the organization may be part
of a wider organizational change agenda, but their focus is on individual change,
using a facilitative style. Consulting in contrast is more likely to be about providing
expert advice to individuals, teams or the board.
One boundary area is team coaching. In our view team coaching is a different
intervention to individual coaching. Working with a team as a group, even with a
facilitative style, is different from working individually with members of the team.
We suggest there is more in common between Team Coaching and Action Learning
Sets, than there is in one-on-one coaching, with an intimate, personal and intense
relationship is created and where the coach is wholly present with the client moment
to moment during the coaching session. Such intensity of connection cannot be
created within a group. Team and group coaching can be hugely beneﬁcial, but its
successful delivery requires an additional skill set beyond the core competences of a
personal coach.
Conclusion
In summary coaching is a distinctive approach. It is different from mentoring
counseling, and consulting through its focus on a one-on-one, facilitated relation-
ship, which is short term and generally focused on helping clients identify and work
toward a goal or new insight.
12

What Is Coaching?

In working with clients, coaches need to ensure clients understand during the
contracting process what coaching is and how it can help them. This helps to create a
shared understanding of how the coach and client will work together and secondly
helps to manage the client’s expectations as to what the coach will and won’t do
during the coaching assignment.

Chapter 3
Who Am I?
Introduction
In coaching, understanding who we are, is as important as understanding what is
coaching. The coach plays a central role in the work with the client. We might even
say the coach is the tool in the coaching relationship. By understanding themselves
the coach can help get out of the way of the work the client needs to do, as well as
using themselves through self-disclosure and stories to help clients on their journeys
of self-discovery.
In this chapter we will think about ourselves as a central tool in the coaching
process and consider ways the coach can develop a deeper understanding of them-
selves by becoming more self-aware. One way for doing this is through self-
reﬂection using personality questionnaires, another is through using a personal
journal and the third is by consciously seeing their coaching practice as a continual
learning journey of self-discovery. We will look at these different approaches.
Who Am I?
Coaching is a highly personal process. It requires the coach to be authentic. Through
this, a relationship of trust can develop, allowing clients to become more open and
intimate in their coaching work. At the same time the coach needs to keep out of the
way. The coach’s task is to manage the process, without signiﬁcantly shaping,
directing or inﬂuencing the content.
In our view the coach is a tool that can help their client to achieve their agreed
goal. This goal may be a new insight about themselves or a situation, or a plan of
action. To achieve this, the coach needs to have a high degree of self-awareness: To
know when to intervene and when to step back: Intervening to provide a reﬂection,
reframing, offering a metaphor or insight. Stepping back by using silence, to allow

the client to reﬂect and process the conversation, allowing them time for personal
insights to emerge.
Self-Awareness and Self-Reﬂection
The terms self-awareness and self-reﬂection are often used interchangeably, as if
they mean the same thing. We however see a difference between them. For us Self-
reﬂection is a process that the coach can engage in, which will help them develop a
greater capacity to be more self-aware. In contrast self-awareness is the outcome of
this process. It enables the coach to become more sensitive to and aware of
their feelings, behaviors and thoughts, and to place these within the context of
their personal history and personality and in response to their environment and
their client.
Individuals with a high capacity for self-awareness are more likely to:
•
Be willing to take a candid look at them self.
•
Identify strengths and areas for improvement.
•
Be able to experience a full range of emotions.
•
Identify and heal their deepest emotions.
•
Stop doing things that don’t work.
•
Think, feel and behave consciously.
•
Act more proactive.
•
Be willing to learn, grow and change.
•
Be open to new experiences.
•
Be more comfortable with their own vulnerabilities
Lens
There are wide number of ways we can become more self-aware and understand
ourselves better. Coaching is one of these ways, as is gathering feedback from others
and observing our own behaviors, thoughts and emotions. However, simply observ-
ing, getting feedback and having coaching does not generate the self-awareness. We
need to think about the data we are gathering and make sense of it for ourselves. In
other words, we need to reﬂect on this feedback.

Who Am I?

The Personality Type Lens
Psychometric questionnaires can be a very useful tool to help us look at ourselves.
There are scores of different personality questions that we can use (see for a
discussion of a wide range of psychological tools for coaching Passmore, 2012).
Some of these questionnaires are Type based models of personality. These draw on
the ideas of Carl Jung (Jung, 1923). The most popular examples are MBTI, TDI,
Insights, DISC and 16 Personalities. These questionnaires help us think about our
behavioral preferences.
Jung proposes that each person has behavioral preferences and by understanding
these preferences we can better understand ourselves and also adjust our behavior
toward others, reducing conﬂict or improving our relationships with others
(Jung, 1923).
As a coach, we can use the questionnaires with our clients (given appropriate
training) and also with ourselves, to deepen our understanding of our own prefer-
ences and how these might affect our approach to coaching.
In Table 3.1 we have summarized the four orientations, based on the four key
questions that the model asks us to consider. This is followed by a Table 3.2 which
explores the preferences in relation to coach behavior.
The theory behind the 16 Personalities, MBTI and the other Jungian question-
naires states that we all have preferred ways of relating to the world. For example, we
may have a preference for using either our right hand or our left hand when we write
which feel easier or more comfortable. What it does not assess is how capable we are
in writing. In doing so, we tend to ignore the possibility of using the left hand. If we
do try to use the left-hand we may describe the experience as ‘awkward’ or
‘unnatural’.
Like the left hand/right hand dichotomy, 16 Personalities shows us how we have
two choices in relating to the world around us and we tend to choose one at the
expense of the other. There are four areas where we are confronted by this choice.
The ﬁrst area is represented by the choice between Introversion (I) and Extraver-
sion (E). The second area is represented by the choice between Sensing
(S) and Intuition (N). The third area is represented by the choice between Thinking
(T) and Feeling (F). The fourth area is represented by the choice between Judging
(J) and Perceiving (P).
The Personality Trait Lens
A different way of thinking about personality is to look at personality traits. The
most common model is the Big Five, which is sometimes called the OCEAN Model.
The model is based on ﬁve factors: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Agreeableness and Neuroticism (Table 3.3).
The Personality Trait Lens
17

Table 3.1 Four questions
Question 1: Where do people gain their energy?
Extraversion
People who prefer extraversion gain energy
from the external world of people and events.
They focus their attention on things in the
external world. They are invigorated by
interacting with people and events.
• Sociable
• Seeks excitement in external world
• Gregarious, with a wide circle of friends
• Speak ﬁrst, think later
• Breadth of interests
• Find out what they think by talking
• Expressive
• After a hard day’s work, extraverts might
typically recover their energies by going out
with a group of friends.
Introversion
People who prefer introversion gain energy
from the inner world of thoughts and feelings.
They prefer to focus attention on their internal
world, often because there is so much hap-
pening there. They are invigorated by spending
time alone with their thoughts and feelings.
• Quiet
• Deep
• Think ﬁrst, speak later
• Private and contained
• Prefer one or two close friendships
• Depth of interests
• Prefer to express ideas through writing
• After a hard day’s work, introverts might
typically recover their energies by having a
quiet evening in with a close friend.
Question 2: What type of data do people pay attention to?
Sensing
People who prefer sensing take in information
through their ﬁve senses, trusting what they can
see, hear and touch. They prefer information
that is tangible, concrete and present focused.
They are observant of the real world around
them and are prefer detail and practical problem
solving.
• Practical
• Present focused
• Detail conscious
• Focused on what is real and tangible
• Trust experience
• Like facts
• Need to have the facts presented one by one
Intuition
People who prefer intuition take in information
by seeing the big picture, focusing on the
relationships and the wider, strategic implica-
tions of facts. They are attuned to the meanings
of facts—the trends, the implications, the pat-
terns behind the facts. They are prefer new
possibilities and different ways of doing
things.
• Abstract and theoretical
• Imaginative
• Future oriented
• Trust intuitive insights
• Strategic
• Like ideas
• Need to have the big picture in order to see
the relevance of facts
Question 3: How do people make decisions?
Thinking
People who prefer to use thinking in decision
making tend to look at logic, facts and objective
analysis. They want to ﬁnd out the objective
truth of a situation. Alternatively, they will look
for the best possible outcome according to the
ideals of fairness and justice.
• Analytical
• Objective
• Logical problem solvers
• Impersonal
• Fair
• Principled
• Task centered
Feeling
People who prefer to use feeling when making
decisions will use their subjective feelings to
guide their judgment. They are attuned to the
needs of others, are empathic and weigh the
feelings of others in their decision making.
They value compassion, appreciation of others
and interpersonal harmony.
• Sympathetic
• Compassionate
• Attuned to the needs of others
• Responsive to others’ feelings
• Guided by personal values
• Subjective
• People centered

Who Am I?

While little research has explored personality preferences and coaching styles
(see Jones et al., 2014), we might conclude from other areas of research that
Conscientiousness will help in learning and application. High Conscientiousness
scores are associated with work success. Maybe this is not surprising. As Jack
Nickolas the famous golf player is once reputed to have said “the harder I practice,
the luckier I get”.
A second factor which may inﬂuence coaching outcomes is agreeableness.
Individuals more able to build trusting relationships who are empathetic and selﬂess
are likely to be better able to build relationships with clients, and we might suggest
this may make them better coaches than those who are selﬁsh or self-serving.
Finally, we might assume that coaches with high neuroticism scores may be less
effective coaches. Being highly emotional, insecure and vulnerable, are likely to be
negatively correlated with successful coaching outcomes. However, from training
hundreds and hundreds of coaches over the years, I know a good many coaches who
are Neurotic, and have developed skills to manage their Neuroticism when they are
with clients.
The Third Lens
A third personality lens to look at ourselves through is specialist questionnaires.
These might include emotional intelligence questionnaires like EQI and MSCEIT,
resilience questionnaires like MTQ48, leadership questionnaires like TLQ and
ILM72 and strengths questionnaires like VIA. (We will explore VIA in Chap. 4:
Who are my clients?)
Table 3.1 (continued)
Question 4: How do people orient their lives?
Judging
People who prefer to use their judging process
in the external world like to live in a planned,
orderly way. They like to make decisions, reach
closure and then put a structured plan into place
in order to implement them. Plans, schedules
and getting things done are important to them.
• Scheduled
• Organized
• Methodical
• Decisive
• Good at implementing decisions
• Get things done
• Plan in advance
• Dislike last minute changes
Perception
People who prefer to use their perceptive pro-
cess in the external world like to live in a
spontaneous, ﬂexible way. They prefer to
understand and experience life rather than
control it. They prefer to delay decisions until
the last minute, staying open to possibilities
and options.
• Spontaneous
• Flexible
• Leave things to the last minute
• Respond to change
• Casual
• Prefer to delay decision making
• Respond to the moment
• Avoid rigid plans

Who Am I?

Each of these questionnaires provides a different perspective on who we are,
offering us the opportunity to think about ourselves, and how our preferences or style
of engaging can help or hinder our approach as a leader or as a coach.
As part of your development we would encourage you to complete 2 or 3 different
questionnaires and spend some time journaling and reﬂecting on how these may
impact on you, your approach to coaching, and how you build and maintain
relationships with your clients.
Journaling
Having explored a variety of different lens, it is important to reﬂect on this feedback
and to develop a coaching mindset (we will discuss this mindset in more depth in
Chap. 7). The coaching mindset aims to encourage us to be open, curious, ﬂexible
and client centered.
Box 3.1 Coaching Mindset
1. Acknowledges that clients are responsible for their own choices
2. Engages in ongoing learning and development as a coach
3. Develops an ongoing reﬂective practice to enhance one’s coaching
4. Remains aware of and open to the inﬂuence of context and culture on self
and others
5. Uses awareness of self and one’s intuition to beneﬁt clients
6. Develops and maintains the ability to regulate one’s emotions
7. Mentally and emotionally prepares for sessions
8. Seeks help from outside sources when necessary
One way of exploring and noting our development is a personal journal. As part
of your daily or weekly practice as a new (or as an experienced coach) is to start
writing a journal. The purpose is to provide a record of your developmental journey.
You might start by writing about the start of your journey. We have suggested
some useful questions to consider as your start this journey in Box 3.2. These are not
an exhaustive list, but may provide a platform to start your exploration.
Some people like to use a long hand style, writing whole sentences about their
experiences in a highly structured and considered way. Others prefer to write using a
stream of consciousness—dictation software is often great for this style of writing.
Finally, others prefer a more ﬂuid approach, using a mind map, drawings, and a less
structured style. The style is less important, what is important is that this provides a
mechanism for you to capture your thinking and a record to reﬂect back on each
month or each year, that highlights your journey and what you considered to be
important at that time.
Journaling
21

We appreciate that some people ﬁnd this process hard. We would urge you to
keep in mind this is your ‘secret’ journal. It’s not for anyone else to read, review or
assess. There are no right or wrong answers, and no right or wrong way to write the
journal. It’s your choice.
Box 3.2 Starting Your Learning Journey
A few questions to consider as your start your learning journey
•
What have you done before in your career?
•
What do you know about coaching?
•
What experience have you had of coaching, what happened?
•
What attracted you to coaching?
•
What do you want to get from learning more about coaching?
•
What gifts are you bringing to the journey?
•
What areas of learning do you think you will need to really focus on?
Reﬂective Practice
The purpose of writing is not only to create a record of where we have come from,
but more importantly to provide an opportunity for reﬂection. In the past there has
been a focus in coaching on practice. The more hours the better the coach:
More coaching hours ¼ Better coach
But we know this is not as simple as this. Our experience of driving a car reminds
us that simply spending more hours driving a car does not always equate to
continuous improvement. What matters just as much in this equation is a growth
mindset (i.e. being open to and having a desire for improvement) and reﬂecting back
on each driving experience with a question, what can I learn from that experience to
become a better driver. The journal is a tool which we can use to encourage the
reﬂective process. It helps us to make the time to stop and consider what has been
going on, and to capture these thoughts. Later in this book (in Chap. 30) we will offer
you a structured process for reﬂection, using eight questions to guide your way.
Understanding Ourselves
Whether you complete 2 or 22 questionnaires, each is only a black and white pen
sketch of who you are. The reality is we are inﬁnitely more complex, multi layers and
variable than any single questionnaire can explain. Phillip Larkin, a 1960s British
22
3
Who Am I?

poet, noted this complexity of what it is to be human in his phrase “the million
petalled ﬂower” of human existence (Larkin, 1974).
While questionnaires are useful, and we would encourage you to use them as one
way of exploring more about who you are, we also issue a caution: Don’t let the
questionnaire deﬁne or limit you. The questionnaire only produces a report based on
what you put in. The evidence is we all change over time as a result of different
learning and life experiences. Thus if you complete the same form after 12 months
on a coaching course, your results are likely to show some differences to the report
you received on day one of the course. Further, how you see yourself while at home
or how you perceive yourself on a course may well be different to how colleagues
perceive you at work or how your friends see you at a social event.
Conclusion
In this chapter we have argued that self-awareness is an important part of coach
development. Self-awareness can be developed through active self-reﬂection, based
on insights and evidenced gathered from feedback and also tools like psychometric
questionnaires. We looked at three different lens; type, trait and what we called the
“third lens.” By using 2 or 3 questionnaires coaches can help gain new insights when
we reﬂect on this data, as well as reﬂecting more generally on our coaching practice.
We suggest one way of doing this is through a personal journal. We also urged
caution. The results from any one questionnaire are not the full picture of who we
are, as humans we are multifaceted, complex, and amazing.
Conclusion

Chapter 4
Who Are My Clients?
Introduction
In Chap. 3 we argued that self-awareness was an important aspect for the coach, and
we offered some ideas for becoming more self-aware through using different lens to
consider who we are. These included psychometrics as well as self-reﬂection and
journaling. We believe the same principles apply to thinking about our clients. We
believe each is a unique person, with their own personal strengths, as well as their
own biases, prejudices and ‘messed-up-ness’ of what it is to be human, but in spite or
maybe because of these, they are wonderful.
In this chapter we draw again on the concept of the coaching mindset, applying
the idea to how we think about and see our clients. Should we see them as people to
be ‘ﬁxed’ or as wonders to behold?
Deﬁcit Psychology Model v Positive Psychology Model
For the ﬁrst 100 years or so years psychology’s primary focus was toward explaining
dysfunction. This deﬁcit, or disease model, as it has become known, meant that
psychologists were highly active in thinking about, researching and writing about
human mental illness and dysfunction. This led to classiﬁcations such as DSM, a
manual which describes hundreds of mental conditions, how to diagnose them and
how to ‘ﬁx’ them.
What got neglected was the more positive side of human functioning. What do
humans do when they are at their best? Of course, there were many examples of
individual psychologists like Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow, and movements
like the Human Potential Movement, who were concerned with these aspects over
this period, but this was far outweighed by a focus on negative behaviors and
functioning.

In the last few decades greater focus has been placed on these more positive
aspects of human behavior. Out of the Human Potential Movement, also known as
humanistic psychology, has come positive psychology. This new approach argues
that we need to consider equally positive aspects of human functioning, as opposed
to solely focusing on the negative, and to study this with similar methods, speciﬁ-
cally quantitative methods, as dysfunction.
Lens
As we suggested at the start of the chapter a useful starting point for this approach is
to consider our mindset. As a coach, are we looking for what’s wrong in our clients,
or are we helping them to look for what’s right? The ICF competency of the
Coaching Mindset, while sometimes difﬁcult to observe, encourages us to work
with a positive mindset toward our clients, being open, curious, ﬂexible and client
centered.
While we are not suggesting we need to be naïve and ignore unhelpful behaviors
or clinical issues, we start with a focus on the positive and the potential which rests in
each and every client. One way of exploring or thinking about this is in terms of
strengths.
There are a wide range of strengths tools which have been published (see Box 4.1
for examples).
Box 4.1 Examples of Strength Questionnaires
•
The Values in Action (VIA) Inventory of Strengths
•
Realize2 Strengths Assessment
•
StrengthScope
•

•
High5 Test
In this chapter we will focus on reviewing the most popular and widely used tool
Values in Action (VIA) Inventory of Strengths (Peterson & Seligman, 2004). The
tool was initially developed from a research project to identify and map human
strengths and has now been completed by hundreds of thousands of participants
interested in the concept of strengths.
The model identiﬁed 24 strengths from the research. These are clustered into ﬁve
groups under the headings Wisdom and knowledge, Courage, Humanity, Temper-
ance, Justice, and Transcendence (see Table 4.1).
The writers argued that an awareness of an individual’s strengths can be helpful
for individuals through a virtuous circle. The ﬁrst step is developing awareness. This
may be gained through the completion of a questionnaire such as VIA or from
reﬂecting on personal experience. With awareness the individual can become more
26

Who Are My Clients?

conscious of choices, selecting to draw on one or more of their perceived strengths.
By using these strengths more frequently, the idea is that the individual feels more
conﬁdent and thus is more likely to achieve a positive outcome, which in turn
encourages greater use of the strength (see Fig. 4.1).

It’s worth saying at this point that as in Chap. 3, we urge caution with all
psychometrics. While psychometrics are helpful, we need to be careful they don’t
deﬁne or limit us or how we see our clients. Just because a client scores lower in one
strength than another, for example, higher for Brave and Creative, but lower for
Forgiveness and Love, this does not mean they are unable to forgive or to love
others. Recognize that such tools are tin openers, not tape measures; but we would
encourage you to be curious and explore with the client their perceptions about their
scores.
A second element to consider is how race and gender may affect how people see
themselves and report using the questionnaire. One study (Brdar et al., 2011)
investigated gender differences in the relationship between character strengths and
life satisfaction. Two questionnaires were administered to 818 students (488 females
and 330 males)—the Values in Action Inventory of Strengths and the Satisfaction
with Life Scale. The results revealed that zest, hope, and gratitude had the strongest
link to life satisfaction. What was also interesting was the gender differences which
emerged across 10 of the character strengths, while there was no difference in life
satisfaction scores (Box 4.2).
Box 4.2 Strengths by Gender
The ﬁve highest weighted strengths for women were:
•
integrity
•
kindness
•
love
•
gratitude
•
fairness
The ﬁve highest weighted strengths for men were:
•
integrity
•
hope
•
humor
•
gratitude
•
curiosity
These results suggest that women and men (at least those in this study) see
themselves differently in terms of the strengths they report, which could relate to
cultural factors about the types of strengths different societies value in men and
women in the twenty-ﬁrst century. A second part of the study also looked at men and
women views on predictors for life success, which echoed the main results with
gender differences. These again may echo gender roles: women favoring love and
beauty and men creativity and perspective (Box 4.3).
28

Who Are My Clients?

Box 4.3 Predictors of Life Satisfaction by Gender
Signiﬁcant predictors of life satisfaction are also different.
For women, life satisfaction was predicted by:
•
zest
•
gratitude
•
hope
•
appreciation of beauty
•
love
For men, life satisfaction was predicted by:
•
creativity
•
perspective
•
fairness
•
humor
In reviewing these results, the ﬁndings seem to be partly congruent with gender
stereotypes of what we consider to be desirable in women or men, with women
scoring higher on kindness and love and men scoring more highly on humor and
curiosity.
Non-judgmental, Unconditional Positive Regard
We suggest the coach seeks to cultivate a mind where each client is held in
unconditional positive regard: That we prize each client. This can be hard, as we
often bring our own biases and prejudices into the work we do. So how can we
do this?
Of course, each experienced coach has their own approach. One strategy that I
have found works well for me is to look for “me toos.” What can I ﬁnd in what the
client says, or does that make me think or feel; “me too”? Maybe they like a certain
type of music or sports team, wear a certain style of clothes, or have a certain type of
accent. These can all be things that turn us off, but by searching for and ﬁnding one
“me too” we can start to build a bridge for the coaching relationship.
The second aspect is working to be non-judgmental. This requires us as the coach
to avoid judging our client as good or bad, and accept the client for who they are. Our
role is to help the client to make sense of and to evaluate (evoking awareness) and if
they wish to, to plan and implement change in their thinking, feelings or behavior
(facilitating client growth). But how can we do this?
Like unconditional positive regard, each experienced coach will have their own
approach, and, in some ways, you will need to ﬁnd your own way, but here is one
way that we have found useful. In listening we aim to stay in the present moment—
Non-judgmental, Unconditional Positive Regard
29

as when we start reﬂecting back during a session there is an increased danger of
evaluation. By staying present we can be with the client, actively listening, engage-
ment and encouraging the client to explore for themselves. In this way we can work
with issues that in other situations might cause distress, anger, frustration or sadness.
Our time for reﬂection is to note such feelings after the session in our journal and to
take these emotional responses to supervision.
As you engage in your coaching training it is worth spending time with your
supervisor, mentor coach, and your trainer to reﬂect on the question: What would be
the “worst” thing a client could say to you? Here are some examples from our work
as trainers (Box 4.4). Of course, someone else’s “worst” might be your “best,” or at
least not cause you any anxiety or emotional response. We each have our own
personal perspectives. Thinking through what yours are, will help you to better
understand the diversity of the world, and how people may think, feel or behavior
toward you.
You may like to give some thought to, and write down in your own personal
learning journal your “worst” four or ﬁve examples might be.
Box 4.4 Examples of the “Worst” Things a Client Could Say
“I am having an affair with X (insert the name of someone you respect or love
here)?”
“I think you are a terrible coach and I am going to report you to the ICF
for. . . . (insert what you feel is your weakest aspect of your coaching practice
here)?”
“I need to tell you I have just been released from prison as I have served a
sentence for. . .(insert the crime which creates the stronger disgust reaction in
you here)”
“I like to dress in women’s clothes at weekends (insert a behavior you ﬁnd
difﬁcult here), and am thinking about how I. . .
“I really hate Christians (insert the faith, gender, ethnic group of your
choice here), they are completely deluded, and I do my best to avoid
employing any in my company”
As we will see later, the ideas of non-judgmental, unconditional positive regard
are drawn from the work of Carl Rogers and his “necessary and sufﬁcient condi-
tions” (Rogers, 1957). We will explore these conditions as part of the humanistic
person-centered approach to coaching in Chap. 16.
Conclusion
In this chapter we have consider how the coach needs to develop and retain a focus
toward their clients. This focus can be developed through the coaching mindset of
positivity, non-judgmental, unconditional positive regard. By avoiding stereotypes,
30

seeing each client as a prize to be held, the coach can start and manage the
relationship in service of their client, avoiding the dangers of their own expertise
and “it’s another case of. . . .”

Part II
Developing Core Coaching Competencies
Introduction
This part looks at the International Coaching Federation’s (ICF) approach to
coaching and coaching competence. We begin in Chap. 5 with a brief history of
the ICF and how the ICF core competency model came about along with an
overview of the competency review process that gave rise to the most recent body
of work being approved in September 2019. We also share a high-level overview of
the model, along with an outline of how this model sits within the ICF requirements
for a credential application at three distinct levels. The subsequent chapters in this
part take each competency in turn and offer a more in-depth exploration of what is
intended by each one and how they are demonstrated in coaching practice.
It is important to note that the competencies are not intended to be applied in any
speciﬁc order. Whilst some aspects lend themselves to being demonstrated at the
early part of a coaching conversation and others toward the end of the conversation,
the reality is that the competencies are intended to be evidenced as a ﬂuid, and
intertwined ﬂow in a natural conversational style. However, for the purposes of this
book, each competency will be addressed in turn and in the order they are noted in
the overall model.
The ICF Core Competency Model is described under four “domains” and we
begin with the Foundation Domain looking at Competency (1) Demonstrates Ethical
Practice in Chap. 6 and Competency (2) Embodies a Coaching Mindset in Chap. 7.
Professional and ethical conduct along with a commitment to developing and
embracing a particular coaching mindset are considered foundational to any good
coaching practice and are therefore positioned as prerequisites upon which sit the
competencies demonstrated and applied with each coaching conversation.
The second domain is called: Co-Creating the Relationship and covers the three
competencies of Competency (3) Establishes and Maintains Agreements in Chap. 8
Competency (4) Cultivates Trust and Safety in Chap. 9 and Competency (5) Main-
tains Presence in Chap. 10. All three of these competencies focus on the importance
of not just building an appropriate relationship with our client, also on creating the

environment and the conditions for the client to work in a safe, trusting and
supported way. The concept of relationships also extends beyond the immediate
client to other parties involved in the ultimate success of the coaching engagement.
Speciﬁc attention is paid to how those relationships and associated agreements
around them are established and maintained. The ﬁnal aspect of the co-created
relationship is how the “being” of the coach inﬂuences and informs the relationship
and how the coach fully maintains presence with their client in service of their
learning and forward movement toward their stated goals and outcomes.
Communicating Effectively is the third domain and compromises the two com-
petencies of Competency (6) Listens Actively in Chap. 11 and Competency
(7) Evokes Awareness in Chap. 12. Effective communication as a coach is a
sophisticated blend of many advanced communication skills. However, in their
simplest form, these two competencies focus on the depth and breadth of how a
coach truly and deeply listens to their client, on many levels. Based on such holistic
listening, the coach is able to engage in the dialogue with their client in a way that
evokes the client’s awareness, inviting them to consider what they are learning and
noticing about themselves and their situation in light of their coaching goals and how
this awareness is useful for their progress toward those goals.
Finally, the domain of Cultivating Learning and Growth comprises Competency
(8) Facilitates Client Growth in Chap. 13. In this chapter we explore how the coach
invites the client to integrate their learning into forward movement beyond the
coaching session or the overall coaching engagement.

Introduction to the ICF Core Competency
Model
Introduction
This chapter introduces the International Coaching Federation (ICF) Core Compe-
tency model. We begin with a brief history of how the core competency model came
about along with an overview of the job analysis that gave rise to the most recent
body of work being approved in September 2019. We also share a high-level
overview of the model, along with an outline of how this model sits within the
ICF requirements for a credential application at three distinct levels. Finally, we
reference some supporting documentation, much of which is fully shared in ICF
(2019).
Background
The International Coaching Federation (ICF) is the world’s largest organization of
professionally trained coaches, with members in more than 145 countries world-
wide. The organization was ﬁrst established in 1995 with the purpose of providing a
space for all coaches to support each other’s development and help grow the
profession of coaching. The ICF has grown rapidly over the past three decades,
reﬂecting the development of coaching and its professionalization. The ICF
launched a single credential of Master Certiﬁed Coach (MCC), the ﬁrst 34 of
which were awarded in 1998. The following year, the Professional Certiﬁed
Coach (PCC) credential was added and the Associate Certiﬁed Coach (ACC)
credential was introduced in 2004.
As an evidenced led organization, the ICF has reviewed the competencies twice
using a job analysis process, drawing on experience and research from practitioners
and academics. The purpose on each occasion is to ensure the ICF competences
reﬂect both developing practice and our growing understanding of the behavioral

and psychological processes involved within the coaching process. The insights
from these reviews are part of a wider process of the continuous improvement of
credentialing which includes the Coach Knowledge Assessment (CKA), assessment
methods, and the curriculum standards for ICF accredited training programs.
The job analysis in 2018–2019 was based upon a rigorous 2-year coaching
practice analysis and was founded on research and evidence collected from more
than 1300 coaches across the world who represented a diverse range of coaching
disciplines, training, backgrounds and coaching styles. The process is summarized
below.
Box 5.1 ICF Job Analysis
ICF Updated Competency Model Phases
The study used a mixed-methods approach that is often used in job analysis
and competency modelling. The ICF-HumRRO (Human Resources Research
Organization) research team completed the following phases of research:
•
Semi-structured interviews with six experienced coaches
•
Workshop to gather written critical incidents in coaching
•
Workshop to determine tasks, knowledge, abilities and other (coach-
speciﬁc) characteristics (KAOs)
•
Survey to validate the tasks and KAOs
•
Workshop to gather feedback on possible competency model updated
•
Updated competency model development and validation
A group of subject matter expert (SME) coaches were also asked to link
coaching tasks to KAOs. This exercise is primarily used to assist in the
development of credentialing assessments rather than updating the compe-
tency model and offers a holistic perspective to the process.
ICF Credential
The ICF offers a globally recognized, independent credentialing program for coach
practitioners. The term “credential”, to describe the designation the coach receives,
reﬂects that the ICF awards a qualiﬁcation which requires periodic renewal. The
intention behind this renewal approach is to ensure that clients of coaching services
from ICF credentialed coaches can be assured that the coach is not only ﬁt for
purpose and ﬁt for practice and has met stringent education and coaching experience
requirements but that they have also demonstrated a thorough understanding of the
ICF Core Competencies. The renewal process veriﬁes that the coach regularly
undertakes continuous professional development activities to maintain and further
develop their knowledge, while also reviewing practice to ensure coaching skills are
maintained and their ethical practice and compliance follows best practice as it
develops within the profession. An ICF credential is renewable every 3 years.
36

Introduction to the ICF Core Competency Model

The ICF offers three levels of credential: Associate (ACC), Professional (PCC)
and Master Certiﬁed Coach (MCC) which require different levels of coach-speciﬁc
training, coaching experience and demonstrable evidence of the use of the ICF’s
Core Competencies.
Here is a summary of the requirements for an ICF credential (*) at each level:
Associate Certiﬁed Coach (ACC):
•
60+ hours of coach-speciﬁc training
•
10 hours of mentor coaching
•
100+ hours of coaching experience following the start of coach training
•
Coach Knowledge Assessment (CKA)
•
Core Competence performance evaluation to ACC level minimum requirements
Professional Certiﬁed Coach (PCC):
•
125+ hours of coach-speciﬁc training
•
10 hours of mentor coaching
•
500+ hours of coaching experience following the start of coach training
•
Coach Knowledge Assessment (CKA)
•
Core Competence performance evaluation to PCC level minimum requirements
Master Certiﬁed Coach (MCC):
•
200+ hours of coach-speciﬁc training
•
10 hours of mentor coaching
•
2500+ hours of coaching experience following the start of coach training
•
Coach Knowledge Assessment (CKA)
•
Core Competence performance evaluation to MCC level minimum requirements
•
Coaches are also required to hold a PCC credential before they can apply for the
MCC credential.
(*) more details and the requirements and application process for each credential
level can be found on the ICF Global website.
ICF Coaching Core Competency Model
The ICF model consists of eight core competencies that sit under four domains (ICF,
2019b). This competency model reﬂects the latest work undertaken by the ICF in the
2018–2019 job analysis noted above. The model was developed with the purpose of
supporting greater understanding about the skills and approaches used within today’s
coaching profession as deﬁned by the ICF. In addition, the ICF core values of
integrity, excellence, collaboration and respect are intended to be at the heart of
the model.

8. Facilitates Client Growth
The Coaching Core Competency Model (ICF, 2019b) and the ICF deﬁnition of
coaching (ICF, 2007) are used as the foundation for the Coach Knowledge Assess-
ment (CKA) (ICF, 2020a, 2020b) which is part of the assessment process for
coaches applying for an ICF Credential. The eight competencies sit within four
domains that represent the core characteristics of a coaching conversation. The
domains and individual competencies are not weighted and do not represent any
kind of priority in that they are all considered core or critical for any competent
coach to demonstrate. As such, this competency model also offers support for
coaches to calibrate the level of alignment between the coach-speciﬁc training
expected by the ICF and the training that a coach has experienced.
In transitioning from the original competency model, the job analysis validated
that much of the original model, developed nearly 25 years ago, remains critically
important to the practice of coaching today. Some elements and themes that emerged
from the data as being either new or of enhanced signiﬁcance have also been
integrated into the updated Coaching Core Competency Model (ICF, 2019b).
These elements and themes will be discussed in more detail in the following
chapters of this section; however, it is worth noting that the review process
highlighted the following areas as paramount for the practice of coaching in today’s
world:
•
Ethical behavior
•
Conﬁdentiality
•
Coaching mindset
•
Reﬂective practice and professional development
38
5
Introduction to the ICF Core Competency Model

•
Expanded focus on the coaching agreement including important distinctions
between various levels of coaching agreements
•
Enhanced concept of partnership between the coach and the client
•
Cultural, systemic and contextual awareness
The combination of the foundational components from the previous model, along
with the new themes which emerged from the job analysis, the updated model
reﬂects the key elements of coaching practice today and serves as a strong and
comprehensive standard for the next phase of the evolution of the coaching
profession.
An important point to make about this competency model is that the domains, the
individual competencies and their sub-competencies are not a checklist and are also
not necessarily chronological. Whilst some aspects of the competencies lend them-
selves to being evidenced at the beginning or the end of a coaching engagement or
session, most of them are seen as behaviors and qualities that the coach might
display at any point and, in many cases, throughout the coaching work. As such,
this model is intended to describe features and characteristics of coaching that
interplay with each other. In this way, the model should be viewed as a holistic
body of work as well its component parts.
The model plays an important role in the design and delivery of coach-speciﬁc
training programs that have been accredited by the ICF. Such programs are required
to demonstrate that at least 80% percent of the training is focused on the ICF Core
Competencies. In this way, students are well educated and prepared for the relevant
assessment process toward their credential application. In the same way that coaches
are evaluated as part of the credentialing and renewal process, an ICF accredited
training provider also undertakes a performance evaluation, audit and renewal
process to maintain their program accreditation, thereby underpinning the rigor
and consistency of quality assurance for students.
Useful Documentation
ICF produces several documents as part of the development, assessment and
credentialing process.
ACC, PCC and MCC Minimum Skills Requirements
The ICF credentialing process with its three levels is a reﬂection of the continuum of
growth that each coach undergoes. Minimum skills requirements have been created
by ICF to support coaches with preparation for either ACC, PCC, or MCC
credentialing performance evaluation. The aim is to help coaches successfully

39

complete their ACC, PCC, or MCC performance evaluation and also to help them
continue to develop their skill set as coaches.
This structure provides those who want to learn and apply these competencies, as
well as those seeking a credential, an understanding regarding what assessors
evaluate in relation to each one. They outline the minimum level of skill necessary
to successfully demonstrate an ACC, PCC, or MCC level of competency. They also
offer an understanding of what behaviors might prevent successful completion of an
ACC, PCC, or MCC performance evaluation process. The intention is that these
documents also help coaches answer questions such as: What does it mean to be an
ACC, PCC, or MCC coach? What do ICF assessors listen for when they are
evaluating an ACC, PCC, or MCC coach? As I progress on my coaching journey,
what are my strengths and what are the skillset areas that I need to grow to pass the
ACC, PCC, or MCC performance evaluation?
Core Competencies Comparison Table
The core competencies comparison table is an adaptation of the Minimum Skills
Requirements documents for each credential level and shows the rating levels at
ACC, PCC, and MCC including pass and non-pass criteria.
PCC Markers
Assessment markers are the indicators that an assessor is trained to listen for to
determine which ICF Core Competencies are in evidence in a recorded coaching
conversation, and to what extent. The PCC markers are the behaviors that should be
exhibited in a coaching conversation at the Professional Certiﬁed Coach (PCC)
level. These markers support a performance evaluation process that is fair, consis-
tent, valid, reliable, repeatable, and defensible. The markers are useful as a bench-
mark and to help understand what is expected at PCC level and they are used as part
of the mentor coaching process. However, they are not a tool for coaching, and
should not be used as a checklist or formula for passing a performance evaluation or
indeed as a checklist for coaching. Details of the PCC Markers can be found on the
ICF website (ICF, 2019d).
ICF Code of Ethics
The ICF is committed to maintaining and promoting excellence in coaching. There-
fore, the ICF expects all members and credentialed coaches (coaches, coach mentors,
coaching supervisors, coach trainers and students), to adhere to the elements and
40
5
Introduction to the ICF Core Competency Model

principles of ethical conduct: to be competent and integrate ICF Core Competency
Model (ICF, 2019b) effectively in their work.
In line with the ICF core values of integrity, excellence, collaboration and respect,
and the ICF deﬁnition of coaching (ICF, 2007), the Code of Ethics (ICF, 2019a) is
designed to provide appropriate guidelines, accountability and enforceable standards
of conduct for all ICF Members and ICF Credential-holders, who commit to abiding
by that Code.
The following chapters in this section will take each domain and competency in
turn and provide an overview of that competency. In addition, there is an intention to
help bring the competencies to life in a practical way with examples and descriptions
to help illustrate the essence of each competency and how they come together in a
great coaching conversation. Finally, Chap. 33: Progressing your Coaching Skills,
outlines some of the differences between ACC, PCC and MCC level coaching and
Chap. 28: Continuous Professional Development shares many ways for you to
develop your coaching skills toward these credentials and your growth as a coach.
Conclusion
In this opening chapter for section “Background”, we have introduced the back-
ground to the ICF’s core competency model and the associated system for becoming
credentialed as a coach at the three levels of ACC, PCC and MCC. Coaching is still a
relatively “young” profession with the concept, deﬁnition and application of
coaching evolving organically. We have therefore also highlighted the key changes
that the ICF’s job analysis highlighted that gave rise to a body of work that is
intended to reﬂect the skills and actions of an effective coach in today’s environ-
ment. The subsequent chapters in this section will take each competency in turn and
offer a more in-depth exploration of what is intended by each one and how they are
demonstrated in coaching practice.

Chapter 6
Foundation Domain, Competency 1:
Demonstrates Ethical Practice
Introduction
The Foundation Domain is focused on how coaches should conduct themselves
while coaching and in all interactions with related individuals. From a broader
competency-development view, the competencies within the foundation domain
would be considered a set of coach-focused competencies (i.e., describing who the
coach “is;” the “being” of the coach), while the other three domains are focused on
coaches’ behavior (i.e., what the coach “does”). In the job analysis process, these
two perspectives are typically framed as “worker” focused versus “work” focused,
respectively.”
This domain has two competencies, Demonstrates Ethical Practice and Embodies
a Coaching Mindset, the essence of which seeks to highlight the level of profes-
sionalism that is expected from an ICF credentialed coach. This professionalism is
considered to be foundational to the coaching practice, upon which the competen-
cies sit and are applied. The professionalism implied within this domain also
particularly embraces two of the ICF core values: integrity and excellence.
Starting with this domain, we see straight away that good coaching is about much
more than demonstrating a skillset, it is also about genuinely and consistently
demonstrating a mindset. A mindset that informs how we approach our work as a
professional and also, how we tend to operate as human beings. In this chapter we
will look at the ﬁrst of these two competencies: Demonstrates Ethical Practice and
the competency of Embodies a Coaching Mindset will be address in the next chapter.
The competency is described in Box 6.1.

1. Demonstrates personal integrity and honesty in interactions with clients,
sponsors and relevant stakeholders.
2. Is sensitive to clients’ identity, environment, experiences, values and
beliefs.
3. Uses language appropriate and respectful to clients, sponsors and relevant
stakeholders.
4. Abides by the ICF Code of Ethics and upholds the Core Values.
5. Maintains conﬁdentiality with client information per stakeholder agree-
ments and pertinent laws.
6. Maintains the distinctions between coaching, consulting, psychotherapy
and other support professions.
7. Refers clients to other support professionals, as appropriate.
Ethical practice as deﬁned within the ICF Code of Ethics (ICF, 2019a) is
considered to be the foundation of the coaching relationship. Understanding of the
code and its consistent application is required for all levels of coaching and the
standard for demonstrating a strong ethical grasp of coaching is similar and rigorous
for all levels of ICF credentialing. In addition, it is noted that this competency
highlights seven sub-competencies for speciﬁc attention.
Demonstrates Personal Integrity and Honesty in Interactions
with Clients, Sponsors and Relevant Stakeholders
This sub-competency is rated as having paramount importance and is an overarching
statement about the expectation of how a coach behaves, not just in a coaching
session but generally as a practitioner in the profession of coaching. The scope of this
expectation goes beyond the coaching client and is extended to the sponsor of the
coaching engagement and indeed all stakeholders. A sponsor is deﬁned as: “an
individual (or entity), usually within an organization, who has a vested interest in
a client’s progress in coaching, is actively promoting the use of coaching for this
individual and is likely providing funds for the coaching”. A stakeholder is deﬁned
as: “an individual (or entity), usually within an organization, who has an interest in a
client’s progress through coaching”. These could be, for example, HR representa-
tives, a broker who has arranged for the coaching engagement or any number of
other relevant third parties. The message here is simply that coaches are expected to
operate with an intention of integrity and honesty at all times and this is exempliﬁed
in all sections of the Code of Ethics.

Foundation Domain, Competency 1: Demonstrates Ethical Practice

Is Sensitive to Clients’ Identity, Environment, Experiences,
Values, and Beliefs
Sensitivity to these aspects of the client’s being implies several important qualities in
the coach. The coach’s capacity to be inclusive, non-judgmental, unbiased and
empathetic in their work with the client are paramount. In addition, the coach’s
ability to understand the effect of these elements on the client, the coaching work and
the coaching relationship are signiﬁcant. In this way, the coach engages and works
with the whole person of the client and not just the coaching goals and topics they
bring into sessions. As our human nature leads us to judge and hold bias as part of
our own moral, ethical or behavioral platform or compass, self-reﬂection and self-
regulation are important aspects of how a coach consistently demonstrates their
integrity and honesty. By way of examples, here are some questions for reﬂection:
•
How do my own religious/spiritual beliefs impact my coaching?
•
How do they align (or not) with the beliefs of my client?
•
What impact does our alignment/misalignment have on our coaching relationship
and the coaching process?
•
Is that helpful or unhelpful to the coaching relationship?
•
How do I respond if my client shares a particularly traumatic experience?
•
How is my response impacted if I have no frame of reference whatsoever for that
experience?
•
How is my response impacted if I have a strong frame of reference for that
experience?
•
Perhaps I have had a similar experience. . .might I “over-empathize”?
•
How do I ensure that I stay present, open and sensitive when my own beliefs,
perspectives, view and/or experiences are different or contrary to the those of my
client?
•
How does my own “view of the world” impact my coaching?
•
How ﬁxed is my view?
•
How do my own identity, environment, experiences, values and beliefs impact
my coaching, both generally and with my clients?
The reﬂective practice of coaching supervision is a very useful and powerful
resource for coaches to check-in and self-regulate around these qualities and the
Code of Ethics also indicates that part of our integrity and honesty means that we will
seek professional support if we feel that we are unable to display these qualities with
a given client and even to terminate the coaching relationship if we feel unable to
resolve any differences or misalignment that might be present. You can read and
learn more about the process and practice of coaching supervision in Chap. 29.

Uses Language Appropriate and Respectful to Clients,
Sponsors, and Relevant Stakeholders
The inter-relation between these seven sub-competencies is hopefully already
becoming apparent and, in this one, we see how our honesty and integrity alongside
our ability to display qualities of sensitivity and inclusivity, can be exempliﬁed in
our language. The language of a coach is intended to strike a delicate and subtle
balance between being considered and intentional as well as spontaneous and
intuitive and at all times respectful toward all parties. This item is also an example
of how the ICF core value of respect is contained within the code of ethics and
competency model.
In order to use appropriate and respectful language, the ﬁrst question is: do I know
what is appropriate and respectful? This takes us back to the previous
sub-competency and highlights why having awareness of, and sensitivity to the
client’s identity and environment is important. Furthermore, we would argue that
attitude is of equal, if not more, importance than identity. For example, a coach may
be aware of and sensitive to someone’s identity, however it is their attitude toward
that identity that will inform how they engage with and coach the person, thereby
informing the language they use and the behaviors they display in the coaching
context. You will see more on attitude and the coach’s “mindset” in the next chapter.
Abides by the ICF Code of Ethics
The ICF Code of Ethics is considered core knowledge for coaching and can be found
on the ICF website (2019a), however here is the purpose and an overview of the
Code:
To elicit the best in each and every ICF coach, ICF members and coaches are
expected to commit to:
•
Ethical behavior as the foundation of the coaching profession.
•
Continued learning in the ﬁeld of coaching as required.
•
Search for continued self-awareness, self-monitoring and self-improvement.
•
Acting and being an ethical individual in all professional interactions.
•
Full accountability for the responsibility undertaken as an ICF Member and coach
•
Complete engagement with and commitment to the coaching profession, setting
an example both to the profession overall and to the community.
•
Uphold the highest standards in a manner that reﬂects positively on the coaching
profession.
•
Be fully present in each and every interaction in which we engage.
•
Recognize and abide by the applicable laws and regulations of each country,
municipality and local governing body.

Foundation Domain, Competency 1: Demonstrates Ethical Practice

•
Provide a safe space for trainers, service providers, coaches and coaches-in-
training to learn, excel ethically and strive to become professional coaches of
the highest caliber.
•
Embrace diversity and inclusion, and value the richness of our global
stakeholders.
The importance of the ICF Code of Ethics is exempliﬁed by the fact that it needs
to be part of the curriculum of ICF Accredited coach-speciﬁc training programs as
well as the work that a coach completes with their mentor coach prior to applying for
their credential (and credential renewal at ACC level). The ICF also offers a
complimentary online course on ethics and one of the ICF Communities of Practice
(also complimentary to ICF Members) is dedicated to ethical discussions and
development.
Ethics is closely linked to personal morals and values. In many cases ethical
decisions are not “black and white”, but instead multiple shades of grey. The ethical
code provides a foundation from which to work, but a reﬂective mindset and process
of inquiry is vital when it comes to thinking through ethical dilemmas which occur in
practice. To help with this, in 2010, Liora Rosen, then Chair of the ICF Ethics
Education Sub Committee developed a simple ethical review checklist (Fig. 6.1).
The steps themselves are self-explanatory; however, Step 4 is worthy of some
further narrative. This step involves exploring four distinct perspectives, the ﬁrst one
of which is “ﬁlters.” In this context, “ﬁlters” refers to a wide range of sources of
reference that we draw upon when making judgments and decisions about some-
thing. These ﬁlters can include, and are not limited to, references relating to our
culture, ethnicity, religion, education, gender, age, geographic location, and

socio-economic background as well as our own needs, values, feelings, and motives
associated with the ethical issue in question. The nature and inﬂuence of these ﬁlters
will inform how we perceive a particular issue or situation.
The second perspective is “rationalizations”, and this refers to the fact that it is
human nature to support something that reinforces our own stance, attitudes, beliefs
and values etc. When considering this alongside the ﬁlters we use as our own
personal and unique sources of reference or “moral compass”, we ﬁnd that our
biases (conscious and unconscious) will inevitably play a part in how we judge a
situation. For this very reason, the model advocates the consideration of two further
perspectives as well as discussing the situation with others (Step 5) to gain a range of
other inputs in service of a fair and objective review.
The third perspective is to reﬂect upon the ICF core values of integrity, excel-
lence, collaboration and respect to explore the extent to which they have or have not
been honored or breached within the issue under consideration. The ﬁnal perspective
is to explore the feasibility and impact of some alternative approaches and decisions
or responses to the situation in order to begin to identify a possible way(s) forward.
One of the best ways to learn and understand more about the ICF Code of Ethics
is through discussion. By taking ethical scenarios and discussing them with col-
leagues with consideration for the steps in this checklist, a thought-provoking
conversation can highlight how our approach to such scenarios will very likely be
inﬂuenced by our own experiences, values, beliefs and biases (conscious and/or
unconscious).
Here is an ethical case study for reﬂection (Box 6.2).
Box 6.2 Ethical Case Study
One morning, Joe, with whom you’ve been working for several months,
arrived at your coaching meeting late, looking and sounding very serious
and stressed. At ﬁrst, he was tight lipped, sharing only that he was extremely
busy and under a lot of pressure to meet deadlines.
Suddenly he divulged that he was in trouble. There had been a signiﬁcant
error in quoting a price to a customer. He knew it would take hours of his time
to get to the bottom of exactly how and why the error had occurred.
Since he felt pressured for time, he had simply assured the customer that he
would not be ﬁnancially penalized in any way and that Joe’s organization
would absorb the ﬁnancial costs of the error.
The next day in a meeting with the executive leadership team, the execu-
tives decided that the company would refuse to absorb any of the costs of the
error and that the customer would be required to absorb the loss. The execu-
tives were unaware of the promise that Joe had made to the customer.
Joe feels trapped. The culture in the client’s organization is to take time and
care over such proposals and they therefore have less tolerance for rash mis-
takes and last-minute changes in direction or actions. His organization has a
(continued)

Box 6.2 (continued)
fast-paced and even “aggressive” culture and decisions are made and changed
frequently.
He wants your help deciding on a course of action. Your coaching conver-
sation hardly began when he immediately settled on his solution: “I’m going to
lie. I’m going to hide the numbers and somehow cover this thing up. It’s my
only way out.”
As the coach of other managers for the same company, you’ve heard
complaints about Joe not being honest in all of his business dealings and
you have developed a close business relationship with the HR manager
responsible for administering the coaching program.
Although you feel conﬁdent that you have navigated conﬁdentiality issues
well up until this point, this situation is testing your agreements on
conﬁdentiality.
Here are some questions you might take a few minutes to consider:
•
What is the ethical dilemma?
•
What elements of the code does this refer to?
•
What is your recommendation for resolution?
•
Which aspects of the ethical review checklist most informed your thinking?
Here are some thoughts and references from the ICF Code of Ethics that could
inform the ethical discussion and decision-making around this particular case study:
Part Four: Ethical Standards
Section I: Responsibility to Clients
Item 2: Create an agreement/contract regarding the roles, responsibilities and
rights of all parties involved with my Client(s) and Sponsor(s) prior to the com-
mencement of services.
•
Who is the sponsor in this situation, and do you have a coaching service
agreement with them?
•
If so, what is your responsibility in honoring that agreement?
Item 3: Maintain the strictest levels of conﬁdentiality with all parties as agreed
upon. I am aware of and agree to comply with all applicable laws that pertain to
personal data and communications.
•
Has Joe broken the law?
•
What type of breach does his lying imply, if any?
Abides by the ICF Code of Ethics
49

•
What does your client’s organization state about lying or misrepresentation of
data etc. in their company policy?
•
Does this situation constitute a breach of their company “law”?
Item 4: Have a clear understanding about how information is exchanged among
all parties involved during all coaching interactions.
•
What have you contracted for in the tri-partite coaching service agreement around
the exchange of information?
Item 5: Have a clear understanding with both Clients and Sponsors or interested
parties about the conditions under which information will not be kept conﬁdential
(e.g., illegal activity, if required by law, pursuant to valid court order or subpoena;
imminent or likely risk of danger to self or to others; etc.). Where I reasonably
believe one of the above circumstances is applicable, I may need to inform appro-
priate authorities.
•
If Joe lying does constitute an appropriate reason for you to breach your pledge of
conﬁdentiality, have you outlined this in your coaching service agreement and did
Joe (and the Sponsor) knowingly agree to that limit of conﬁdentiality?
Section II: Responsibility to practice and performance
As an ICF Professional, I
Item 17: Recognize my personal limitations or circumstances that may impair,
conﬂict with or interfere with my coaching performance or my professional
coaching relationships. I will reach out for support to determine the action to be
taken and, if necessary, promptly seek relevant professional guidance. This may
include suspending or terminating my coaching relationship(s).
You have heard complaints about Joe’s honesty, and you have a close business
relationship with the HR manager responsible for administering the coaching
program. . .
•
Is this enough to constitute a “personal issue”?
•
Do you have a bias (conscious or unconscious) toward Joe based upon what you
have heard?
•
Does the closeness of your relationship with the HR Manager impact how you
view Joe and this situation?
•
Is any of this enough to impair your performance as a coach in this situation?
At this stage Joe has not yet lied, he is talking about his decision to lie. How does
that impact this situation and your potential response? Finally, are there any other
parts of the Code of Ethics that you feel could be relevant or inform your thinking
about this type of scenario?
In most cases, ethical breaches by coaches are the result of a simple mistake or
lack of awareness, consideration or knowledge as opposed to a deliberate or inten-
tional breach. What is important is that coaches take care to consider ethical matters
within their coaching practice and also feel supported by sources of reference and
50
6
Foundation Domain, Competency 1: Demonstrates Ethical Practice

guidance. Peer group discussions, communities of practice and special interest
groups are all potential sources of such support (remembering that client and sponsor
conﬁdentiality need to be maintained whilst such discussions are being held). Ethical
dilemmas and questions are also ideally placed to be taken into a conversation with a
coaching supervisor as part of the coach’s ongoing practice management and
professional development. The ICF offers a mechanism for complaints about indi-
viduals or programs to be reviewed, which is the Ethical Conduct Review Process
and Program Complaint Process. These are handled by the Independent Review
Board (IRB).
In Chap. 23 we offer an alternative model to review ethical decisions; the
APPEAR model (Passmore and Turner, 2018). Such models are useful heuristics
to guide you through what can be difﬁcult and challenging processes of managing
ethical dilemmas, and encourage you to think more widely and take account of the
individual and unique circumstances in each case, as we seek to balance the needs of
our client, the organization and our own moral, legal and contractual responsibilities.
Maintains Conﬁdentiality with Client Information per
Stakeholder Agreements and Pertinent Laws
Conﬁdentiality has always been an important feature of a coaching relationship and
has been further highlighted as a paramount characteristic and frequently used task in
the latest and current ICF Core Coaching Competency Model. To that end, it is
raised several times within the ICF Code of Ethics (Box 6.3).
Box 6.3 Extracts from the ICF Code of Ethics
Part 2: Key Deﬁnitions
“Conﬁdentiality”—protection of any information obtained around the
coaching engagement unless consent to release is given.
Part 4: Ethical Standards
Section I—Responsibility to clients
Item 3: Maintain the strictest levels of conﬁdentiality with all parties as
agreed upon. I am aware of and agree to comply with all applicable laws that
pertain to personal data and communications.
Item 5: Have a clear understanding with both Clients and Sponsors or
interested parties about the conditions under which information will not be
kept conﬁdential (e.g., illegal activity, if required by law, pursuant to valid
court order or subpoena; imminent or likely risk of danger to self or to others;
etc.). Where I reasonably believe one of the above circumstances is applicable,
I may need to inform appropriate authorities.

Box 6.3 (continued)
Item 7: Maintain, store and dispose of any records, including electronic
ﬁles and communications, created during my professional interactions in a
manner that promotes conﬁdentiality, security and privacy and complies with
any applicable laws and agreements. Furthermore, I seek to make proper use
of emerging and growing technological developments that are being used in
coaching services (technology assisted coaching services) and be aware how
various ethical standards apply to them.
Section II—Responsibility to practice and performance
Item 19: Maintain the privacy of ICF Members and use of the ICF Member
contact information (email addresses, telephone numbers, and so on) only as
authorized by ICF or the ICF Member.
(ICF, 2019a)
A couple of points are worthy of further highlight as follows.
The term “maintain strictest levels of conﬁdentiality” means that a coach must
take all steps possible to ensure that the content of the coaching conversations stays
only between the coach and the client. This means taking great care with any
coaching notes that may have been taken, ensuring they are unseen by others and
are anonymized wherever possible. It also means taking care with any client data that
may be stored on a laptop, iPad, or other electronic equipment so that it is safe and
secure.
Conﬁdentiality also means not verbally sharing content from the coaching con-
versations with others. Here are a couple of examples on how this can be navigated:
•
You may bump into your client’s manager in the corridor and they ask how the
coaching is going—it would not be appropriate to share any update without the
client’s clear, prior agreement. This is an important aspect of the tripartite
contracting conversation when reporting, updating and conﬁdentiality should be
discussed and agreed. Moreover, it is also recommended that it is, in fact, the
client who does any updating and reporting. Direct updating between the client
and the line manager allows for their workplace relationship to stay intact and also
keeps the boundary of accountability for and within the relationship clear and
separate from the coach.
•
You want to discuss a client case with your supervisor . . . part of your contracting
process with your client should include sharing that you engage with a supervisor
as part of your ongoing professional development. Your client should be
informed that this means some client content may be discussed, however the
identity of the client is always kept conﬁdential and the supervisor is also bound
by the same Code of Ethics and conﬁdentiality boundaries.
•
You want to record or transcribe your client session so that you can use the
recording for mentoring or assessment purposes. . .once again, this should be
52
6
Foundation Domain, Competency 1: Demonstrates Ethical Practice

contracted for with your client who would need to give their permission for their
session to be used for these purposes.
•
You work with a virtual assistant (VA) who helps you schedule appointments etc.
. . . the VA also needs to adhere to the Code of Ethics and the client informed of
this as part of the contracting process. A tip here is that, when contracting with the
VA, you share and ask them to sign a copy of the Code of Ethics so that you have
that on ﬁle as part of your contracting documentation with them.
Whilst, it is not stipulated in the competency model or in the Code of Ethics that
coaching agreements and contracts need to be in writing, we highly recommend that
they are. Documenting the key elements of your coaching engagement and then
asking each party to sign that agreement is good professional practice. In this way,
all parties are clear of what is expected of them and what their part is in the coaching
engagement.
What is perhaps striking about these points is that, in most cases, the vehicle for
addressing them professionally is the coaching agreement or contract. When teach-
ing coaching students, we often hear ourselves say: “All roads lead to the contract”
and in many, ways this is true. Thorough contracting is the key to setting a great
foundation to the coaching engagement. We will take a closer look at coaching
agreements in Competency 3, however a ﬁnal note in this section is that conﬁden-
tiality also links to privacy. Data privacy regulation around the world is now much
more rigorous and therefore it is important that a coach ensures they are complying
with requirements such as GDPR and other data privacy requirements around the
world and that this is made clear to clients and other stakeholders in all types of
interactions.
Maintains the Distinctions Between Coaching, Consulting,
Psychotherapy, and Other Support Professions
In a credential application, a coach will pass this aspect of the competency if they
engage in a coaching conversation that is focused on inquiry and exploration and if
the conversation is based on present and future issues.
A pass would not be awarded if the coach focuses primarily on telling the client
what to do or how to do it (consulting mode) or if the conversation is based primarily
in the past, particularly the emotional past (therapeutic mode). In addition, ICF notes
that if an applicant is not clear on basic foundation exploration and evoking skills
that underlie the ICF deﬁnition of coaching, that lack of clarity in skill use will be
reﬂected in skill level demonstrated in some of the other core competencies. For
example, if a coach almost exclusively gives advice or indicates that a particular
answer chosen or suggested by the coach is what the client should do, trust and
safety, coaching presence, powerful questioning, evoking awareness, and client
generated ideas/actions and accountability will also not be present and a credential
application, at any level, would be unsuccessful.

Refers Clients to Other Support Professionals,
as Appropriate
As well as maintaining the distinctions between coaching, consulting, psychother-
apy and other support professions, a coach must also know when and how to refer
their client to another support professional and take appropriate action. As always,
thorough contracting at the beginning of an engagement is the best way to proac-
tively establish clarity around what is and is not being offered within the coaching
relationship and coaching service. This helps mitigate against confusion or misun-
derstanding and thereby potentially avoiding the need for referral.
However, sometimes the coaching process uncovers information, requirements,
expectations and circumstances that mean a different way of working would be more
useful to the client. A couple of examples of this are mentoring and counseling or
psychotherapy.
Sometimes clients engage with a coach when what they actually want is
mentoring. It may be that their requirement is more one of receiving information,
advice, guidance, ideas and strategies than it is one of exploring their own thoughts,
feelings and behaviors to ﬁnd their own solution to an issue or a goal. The ﬁrst thing
to consider is whether there is a difference between what they want and what they
need. A client may want the coach to offer them solutions and answers because that
is perhaps easier than working it out for themselves. In this case, the coach may
encourage, partner with and even challenge the client to reﬂect for themselves in
order to ﬁnd their own solution, thereby staying in the role of coach.
However, it may be that what the client actually needs is indeed mentoring and
there may have been a misunderstanding or miscommunication of the service being
offered at the contracting stage. This is an example of where the coach may propose
that a different way of working might be more useful to the client and explore with
them their options for engaging with a mentor.
Interestingly, this is not as clear as it might appear, and it is not always a simple
case of either coaching or mentoring. The reality is that many coaches wear a number
of different hats: coach, mentor, trainer, facilitator etc. as part of their professional
portfolio. This means that, in practice, some coaches offer a blended service. From
an ICF perspective, this is a perfectly acceptable way of working as long as two
important criteria are met:
1. It is not appropriate to use an example of a blended service when submitting a
client session recording for ICF assessment purposes. The assessment process is
to establish that the coach understands and can apply the core coaching compe-
tencies and stay in coaching mode. Submitting a recording where the coach more
than occasionally steps out of coaching mode is likely to fail an assessment.
2. When logging client hours for ICF credentialing and renewal purposes, the coach
must only log those hours that have been contracted for and provided as coaching,
and not those where a blended service was provided.
54
6
Foundation Domain, Competency 1: Demonstrates Ethical Practice

The other key area for potential referral is when counseling or therapy may be
more appropriate for the client. There may be a time when the client demonstrates
certain behaviors or shares certain information or perspectives which indicate that
another form of professional service or resource might be more appropriate and
useful to the client. This is referenced in the ICF Code of Ethics under Part
3, Section I—Responsibility to clients, item 8: “Remain alert to indications that
there might be a shift in the value received from the coaching relationship. If so,
make a change in the relationship or encourage the Client(s)/Sponsor(s) to seek
another coach, seek another professional or use a different resource.” Guidance on
when and how to refer clients to therapy can be found in an ICF white paper:
“Referring
a
Client
to
Therapy:
A
set
of
Guidelines”
(Hullinger
and
DiGirolamo, 2018).
Some aspects of this competency are not directly assessed during a performance
evaluation; in fact, it is more the absence of this competency that would indicate a
non-pass result. When an assessor reviews a recorded coaching conversation as part
of a credential application, there are two key disqualiﬁers which are (1) if the coach
displays a clear ethical breach (i.e. of the ICF Code of Ethics) and/or (2) if the coach
more than occasionally steps into a role other than that of coach (e.g. counsellor,
consultant, teacher, trainer).
Conclusion
This chapter has introduction the Foundation Domain of the ICF Core Competency
Model and introduced the ﬁrst competency: Demonstrates Ethical Practice. We have
shared the competency deﬁnition and sub-competencies and explored the essential
elements and expectations for each one. We have seen how this competency places
signiﬁcant emphasis on integrity, professionalism, conﬁdentiality and ethical con-
duct. Some of the factors that underlie and underpin a person’s ethical platform have
been described and an ethical case study has been analyzed to highlight some of the
many and varied considerations to take into account when faced with an ethical
scenario. This case study has also been used to identify where the ICF Code of Ethics
can assist in navigating and informing an ethical query and positions the Code as a
very useful source of reference and guidance for coaches as part of their professional
coaching practice. We have also included an ethical review checklist which offers
simple guidelines on how to thoroughly review and consider an ethical scenario, its
implications and its possible solutions.

Foundation Domain, Competency 2:
Embodies a Coaching Mindset
Introduction
The second competency in the Foundation Domain is Embodies a Coaching
Mindset. This is a new competency that emerged from the most recent coaching
job analysis conducted by the ICF as well as a qualitative study of coach’s learning
journeys completed by the ICF Academic Research team. Many of the core coaching
tasks, knowledge and attitudes identiﬁed in the job analysis process included aspects
of reﬂective practice (e.g., reﬂection, awareness and self-regulation). This has been
identiﬁed and emphasized as critical “self-work” that coaches must engage in.
A Coaching Mindset
The competency is described in Box 7.1:
Box 7.1 Competency 2: Embodies a Coaching Mindset
Deﬁnition: Develops and maintains a mindset that is open, curious, ﬂexible
and client-centered.
1. Acknowledges that clients are responsible for their own choices.
2. Engages in ongoing learning and development as a coach.
3. Develops an ongoing reﬂective practice to enhance one’s coaching.
4. Remains aware of and open to the inﬂuence of context and culture on self
and others.
5. Uses awareness of self and one’s intuition to beneﬁt clients.
6. Develops and maintains the ability to regulate one’s emotions.

A Coaching Mindset is considered to be of sufﬁcient importance to be a compe-
tency in its own right and is a key part of describing the “way of being” of the coach.
In practice, it is intended to be noticeably evident throughout the way the coach
works with their client and other relevant parties and notes that, when an individual
learns and is able to practice coaching skills, a transformation frequently occurs
where the individual embodies these skills, they become an inherent part of the
individual’s personality and those skills are consciously or unconsciously used in
conversations throughout their daily lives. As such, a coaching mindset might be part
of how the coach demonstrates all of the other competencies within this framework.
As with Competency 1, Demonstrates Ethical Practice, the theme emerges once
again that qualities such as professionalism, integrity, honesty and a coaching
mindset are foundational to good coaching practice.
This competency is speciﬁcally outlined through eight sub-competencies:
Acknowledges that Clients Are Responsible for Their Own
Choices
This sub-competency immediately focuses on the fact that coaching is client-
centered. Partnership and equality are very important themes within the overall
competency framework. However, within those principles there is also a clear
intention and expectation that it is the client who sets the agenda and direction of
the coaching work. The client is also responsible for generating their own ideas,
actions and next steps. This acknowledgement is probably initiated right at the very
beginning of the coaching engagement when the coach explains to the client (and
any other relevant parties) what coaching is, is not, and how it is different from other
ways of working.
This type of acknowledgement continues throughout the coaching process and
shows up in other competencies, examples of which are when the coach:
•
Partners with the client in the creation of coaching agreements (Competency 3:
Establishes and Maintains Agreements)
•
Demonstrates respect for and acknowledges the client’s perceptions, suggestions
and work in the coaching process (Competency 4: Cultivates Trust and Safety)
•
Invites the client to generate forward moving ideas (Competency 7: Evokes
Awareness)
•
Partners with the client to design goals, actions and accountability methods and
acknowledges and supports the client’s autonomy in doing so (Competency 8:
Facilitates Client Growth).

Foundation Domain, Competency 2: Embodies a Coaching Mindset

Some practical examples of the many things a coach might say or ask to evidence
this sub-competency are:
•
“What would you like to focus on today?”
•
“How would you like to approach this?”
•
“What are your options?”
•
“What do you think?”
•
“What will you do now?”
•
“How do you feel about doing that?”
•
“How committed do you feel about this?”
•
“What will you do to ensure you that you honor your commitment?”
In practice therefore, whilst the coach may explore, inquire, invite, notice, ask and
challenge, these activities are done in complete service of empowering the client to
own and take responsibility for themselves and, as per the ICF deﬁnition of
coaching, be inspired to maximize their personal and professional potential.
Engages in Ongoing Learning and Development as a Coach
Ongoing learning and development are fundamental to the ICF’s philosophy of
coaching. As outlined in Chap. 5, the renewable characteristic of an ICF credential
is to underpin a proactive and intentional commitment to continuous professional
development activities to maintain and further develop the coach’s knowledge,
skills, attitudes and behaviors as a professional practitioner.
The credential renewal process requires that all coaches complete at least 40-h of
Continuing Coach Education across each 3-year period that their credential is valid.
This education is described on the ICF website and can come in various forms,
including:
•
ICF-approved training
•
Other training
•
Self-paced courses and other self-study
•
Mentor Coaching
•
Coaching Supervision
•
Research and Teaching
For those coaches who want to renew their credential at the ACC level, part of
this development must include at least 10 h of Mentor Coaching so that it is clear that
the coach is still fully understanding and applying the core competencies. At least
three-hours of development in coaching ethics is also required for coach’s renewing
their credential at any level, thereby re-emphasizing the importance of ethical
practice and professional conduct. Learning and development opportunities are
available from ICF Chapters and ICF Accredited training schools all around the
world and also via the ICF’s Learning portal.
Engages in Ongoing Learning and Development as a Coach
59

This theme of ongoing learning and development is considered a core task and
activity of a coach as an important part of the “self-work” with which a coach
engages in order to better serve their clients.
From a very practical perspective, taking a proactive approach to this requirement
is highly recommended. We can count many, many examples of when a coach has
approached us because their 3-year credential period expires within the next couple
of months or so and they are suddenly trying to complete 40+ h of development. Not
only is there an expectation of intentionality within the credentialing process, it is
also so much easier to complete this development in a meaningful and cost-effective
way when it is planned ahead across the three periods. It is also this concept of
intentionality that supports the self-work and ongoing learning, which is at the heart
of a “coaching mindset.”
Develops an Ongoing Reﬂective Practice to Enhance One’s
Coaching
Reﬂective practice has been identiﬁed as a speciﬁc and signiﬁcant activity within the
area of ongoing learning and development as outlined in the sub-competency above.
For these purposes, reﬂective practice includes three core tasks of: reﬂection,
awareness and self-regulation.
Such reﬂective practice could take on many forms, some examples of which are:
•
Coaching supervision (see Chap. 29)
•
Peer group reﬂection
•
Journaling
•
Mentor coaching
•
Observed coaching practice followed by debrief and feedback
•
Listening to recordings of client work
As described in Competency 7, Evokes Awareness, the coach is facilitating client
insight and learning for their client. In this case, the coach is role modelling this
behavior for their own insight and learning. Self-regulation can take on several forms
including managing one’s own emotions within the coaching process, the use of
one’s own intuition as well as staying in coaching mode and managing one’s own
inclination to tell, suggest, judge or “ﬁx” the client.
Remains Aware of and Open to the Inﬂuence of Context
and Culture on Self and Others
A key area being addressed with this sub-competency is that of bias: Biases that a
coach may bring into the coaching process and also the biases that clients may have
regarding the coaching work and coaching process. Part of the coaching mindset,
60
7
Foundation Domain, Competency 2: Embodies a Coaching Mindset

therefore, is for the coach to stay conscious to the possible (and probable) presence
of biases (of self or others) and how this might inﬂuence and impact the work that is
being undertaken.
In practical terms, this can be evidenced by the coach owning, acknowledging,
sharing and checking their own possible assumptions for example about the client
and/or the work they are bringing. For example:
•
“I realize I am making an assumption here; however, I am wondering if. . .”
•
“I’d like to check my thinking with you here . . . is . . .?”
•
“Please challenge or correct me if I’m wrong, however you seem to me to. . .”
•
“Tell me if this doesn’t land, I was thinking that perhaps. . .”
This sub-competency may also be demonstrated by the coach inquiring about or
challenging the client’s assumptions which links very closely to some aspects of
other competencies which will be explored in each relevant case. However, as far as
the coach’s biases are concerned, another important and valuable way to explore and
address these is through the process of reﬂective practice as noted in the previous
sub-competency.
Uses Awareness of Self and One’s Intuition to Beneﬁt Clients
The use of intuition in the coaching process is considered very important and is also
a skill to be carefully balanced and managed. Research on the use of intuition shows
a vast range of results, from highly ﬂawed to remarkably accurate and still intuition
can light a creative spark. Using intuition with careful judgment and good sense,
along with a lack of attachment to one’s own sharing may very well stimulate client
awareness or learning.
The coach can share their intuition with the client in several ways, including:
•
“I have a hunch that. . .”
•
“I’m feeling a strong sense of (XYZ), what do you think or feel about that?”
•
“It strikes me that. . .”
Develops and Maintains the Ability to Regulate One’s
Emotions
This links to sub-competency 2.3 and reﬂective practice is considered to be a
valuable vehicle for regulating one’s emotions. Reference to working effectively
and appropriately with the client’s emotions will be further explored in the chapters
focused on Competency 5, Maintains Presence and Competency 6, Listens Actively.
However, in order to work effectively with our client’s emotions, we must ﬁrst be
aware of our own and how to self-manage and self-regulate in such a way that our
Develops and Maintains the Ability to Regulate One’s Emotions
61

emotions do not get in the way of the client or the coaching process. In coaching
supervision, this is sometimes called “where the personal intrudes on the profes-
sional”—you can read more on that in Chap. 29 on Coaching Supervision.
We will bring a particular emotional “state” into the coaching session, based upon
how we are at that time, and our emotions may also be inﬂuenced by what the client
brings into the session. Our ability to regulate our emotions may therefore change
from moment to moment and what is expected is that we are mindful of this and that
we continually check our own responses and reactions so that we can ensure that our
emotions are not coming into the process in an unhelpful way.
The self-awareness that develops as a result of ongoing learning, development
and reﬂective practice is a useful quality that enables us to regulate our emotions.
Examples of when we might need to regulate our emotions are:
•
You have a client who is really very excited about Christmas and is demonstrating
enthusiasm and passion about preparing for the festivities. What if your own
relationship with Christmas is not so positive and you ﬁnd it a period of sadness,
loss or disappointment? How will you regulate our own reactions, responses and
biases?
•
Your client shares that they are getting divorced and you have just recently
experienced a very painful and acrimonious divorce yourself. How will you ensure
that your own emotional experience does not creep into your coaching practice?
•
Your client shares their excitement for an upcoming trip, and they describe a trip
that you did last year which was the most amazing experience of your life. How
will you regulate your emotions so that your own “story” does not take over the
client’s space?
In some cases, if we are unable for some reason to regulate our emotions, it may even
be appropriate to stop working with that client or suspend our coaching practice for a
period of time. For example, if our own life experience means that we are personally
going through a very challenging time, or the topic the client brings is one that is
particularly triggering and sensitive for us, it may simply be that we cannot be sufﬁ-
ciently self-managing and present for others. This is something that is ideally suited for
exploration with a coaching supervisor and is also addressed in the ICF Code of Ethics in
Part Four: Ethical Standards, Section II—Responsibility to practice and performance.
As an ICF Professional, I:
Item 17: Recognize my personal limitations or circumstances that may impair,
conﬂict with, or interfere with my coaching performance or my professional
coaching relationships. I will reach out for support to determine the action to be
taken and, if necessary, promptly seek relevant professional guidance. This may
include suspending or terminating my coaching relationship(s).
Mentally and Emotionally Prepares for Sessions
This aspect really helps to bring Competency 2 together, as it highlights a practice
that enables us to tap into our optimal coaching state or mindset. It draws upon all of
the above aspects of this competency by consciously and intentionally preparing for
62
7
Foundation Domain, Competency 2: Embodies a Coaching Mindset

our client work. This is an ongoing process as part of our continuous professional
and personal development and is also a speciﬁc activity in readiness for each
coaching session. Outputs from the competency review process and also ICF
research undertaken into how coaches spend their time highlight that good coaches
demonstrate this practice.
Such preparation can take on different forms and will vary based upon the
personal preferences of the coach. This could include activities such as going for a
walk, taking some exercise, meditating, sitting quietly, and reﬂection. It could also
include consideration for other aspects of when and how the coach can access their
optimal coaching mindset, for example:
•
Are there days of the week or times of the day when the coach is “at their best”?
•
How many clients can the coach engage with in one day and still be fresh,
professional, present and available for each one?
•
How much space in between client engagements does the coach need in order to
be fully prepared for their next client?
A useful paper on this is by DiGirolamo et al. (2016).
Seeks Help from Outside Sources When Necessary
The previous elements of this competency are designed to support the development
of a good coaching mindset. However, we have also ready seen above some
examples of when and how our mindset could be impaired or impacted in a way
that is not helpful to our client or the coaching process. In these cases, it is therefore
important that coach seeks the support needed for them to address this in whatever
way is most appropriate. Coaching Supervision is a very useful source of support
and this is covered more in Chap. 29.
Conclusion
This chapter has introduced and outlined the new competency that has become part
of the updated ICF Core Competency model. This addition underscores the impor-
tance of the being of the coach as well as the doing of coaching and the fact that the
role of the coach extends beyond direct interaction with the client and other
stakeholders. We have explored each of the sub-competencies and how they in
turn link directly to and are in support of other competencies within the model.
We have also highlighted various ways that coaches can engage with and meet this
competency as a valuable part of their ongoing development towards coaching
maturity.

Co-creating the Relationship Domain,
Competency 3: Establishes and Maintains
Agreements
Introduction
This domain comprises the three competencies of (3) Establishes and Maintains
Agreements, (4) Cultivates Trust and Safety and (5) Listens Actively. It is a
collection of competencies which relate to the logistics involved prior to and within
coaching engagements and sessions, as well as those which lead to client growth and
development.
This chapter focuses on Competency 3. Establishes and Maintains Agreements
and positions three distinct levels of agreement that are expected as follows:
1. Agreements for the coaching relationship
2. Agreements for the overall coaching plan and goals
3. Agreements for the session goals and objectives
These distinct levels have emerged more formally in the most recent competency
framework and reﬂect the ongoing development and maturity of the coaching
process and the coaching profession.
The competency is described in Box 8.1.
Box 8.1 Competency 3: Establishes and Maintains Agreements
Deﬁnition: Partners with the client, and relevant stakeholders, to create clear
agreements about the coaching relationship, process, plans, and goals. Estab-
lishes agreements for the overall coaching engagement as well as for those for
each coaching session.
1. Explains what coaching is and is not and describes the process to the client
and relevant stakeholders.

Box 8.1 (continued)
2. Reaches agreement about what is and is not appropriate in the relation-
ship, what is and is not being offered, and the responsibilities of the client
and relevant stakeholders.
3. Reaches agreement about the guidelines and speciﬁc parameters of the
coaching relationship such as logistics, fees, scheduling, duration, termi-
nation, conﬁdentiality, and inclusion of others.
4. Partners with the client and relevant stakeholders to establish an overall
coaching plan and goals.
5. Partners with the client to determine client-coach compatibility.
6. Partners with the client to identify or reconﬁrm what they want to accom-
plish in the session.
7. Partners with the client to deﬁne what the client believes they need to
address or resolve to achieve what they want to accomplish in the session.
8. Partners with the client to deﬁne or reconﬁrm measures of success for
what the client wants to accomplish in the coaching engagement or
individual session.
9. Partners with the client to manage the time and focus of the session.
10. Continues coaching in the direction of the client’s desired outcome unless
the client indicates otherwise.
11. Partners with the client to end the coaching relationship in a way that
honors the experience.
(ICF, 2019b)
The essence of this competency is in getting clear agreement as to the appropri-
ateness and suitability of the coaching relationship and the work that is being done
within that coach-client relationship for each session.
The essential element of this competency is that the coach:
•
Establishes and maintains agreement at all three levels as outlined
Level 1: Agreements for the Coaching Relationship
•
Explaining what coaching is and is not and describing the process to the client and
relevant stakeholders.
•
Reaches agreement about what is and is not appropriate in the relationship, what
is and is not being offered, and the responsibilities of the client and relevant
stakeholders.
•
Reaches agreement about the guidelines and speciﬁc parameters of the coaching
relationship such as logistics, fees, scheduling, duration, termination, conﬁdenti-
ality, and inclusion of others.
66

Co-creating the Relationship Domain, Competency 3: Establishes and Maintains. . .

•
Partnering with the client to determine client-coach compatibility.
•
Partnering with the client to end the coaching relationship in a way that honors the
experience.
Level 2: Agreements for the Overall Coaching Plan
and Goals
•
Partnering with the client and relevant stakeholders to establish an overall
coaching plan and goals with associated measures of success for the coaching
engagement.
•
Establishing an understanding of the importance or signiﬁcance of the coaching
work and the client’s commitment to the coaching engagement.
•
Continuing the coaching in the direction of the client’s desired outcome unless
the client indicates otherwise.
In cases of coaching for and within organizations, when agreement is reached that
coaching would likely provide positive results, agreements may be made between
the coach and the organization for one or more engagements with speciﬁc or
potential clients. In these cases, the discussions to reach agreement on some aspects
of Levels 1 and 2 may be between the coach and the organization.
In cases where a coach engages with clients directly and an organization is not
involved, the elements will be agreed upon directly between the coach and client.
The activities undertaken at Levels 1 and 2 are often formalized into a written
coaching “contract,” which is signed by the relevant parties involved.
Level 3: Agreements for the Session Goals and Objectives
Lastly, in each session coaches frequently begin with an informal, verbal agreement
regarding what will be covered in the session, including:
•
Partnering with the client to identify or reconﬁrm what they want to accomplish in
the session.
•
Partnering with the client to deﬁne or reconﬁrm measures of success for what the
client wants to accomplish in the individual session.
•
Partnering with the client to deﬁne what the client believes they need to address or
resolve to achieve what they want to accomplish in the session.
•
Partners with the client to manage the time and focus of the session.
•
Continuing the coaching in the direction of the client’s desired outcome unless
the client indicates otherwise.
Level 3: Agreements for the Session Goals and Objectives
67

The Importance of Coaching Agreements
One of the things that we have noticed many times in our roles as coach trainers is
that very often this competency is not fully explored. It is the depth and extent to
which the coach deﬁnes and explores the coaching agreement and the client’s
desired outcome for the work that is important. So, let’s now bring all of these
guidelines and requirements together to get to the core of what is required for this
competency. Levels 1 and 2 of Coaching Agreements focus on careful and thorough
professional practice and are relatively self-explanatory. It is the competence a coach
shows at Level 3, i.e., establishing and maintaining the agreement during each
coaching session that is worthy of further exploration.
Newly trained coaches sometimes feel that they have to get to the goal of the
coaching quickly so that they can get on with the “real work” of coaching the client
and yet there is such rich territory in working more extensively and deeply with the
client to understand what they want to achieve and why it is important to them. In
fact, establishing the coaching agreement is something that can occur over the course
of the ﬁrst half of a session or even take a full session to fully explore and establish
clarity for the overall coaching engagement. This process does not have to be
completed within the ﬁrst few minutes of the conversation and indeed may also be
revisited at any point throughout the session.
Whilst every coaching conversation is different of course and has its own unique
trajectory and pace, there is a concept that we ﬁnd useful when teaching this
competency and that is to imagine a simple structure that holds true for any great
story, book, report, project, essay or assignment which is that it has a beginning, a
middle and an end. The same is also true for coaching and it is important that all of
these three important phases are fully explored and the extent to which we effec-
tively work with one part will inevitably affect how we work with the other two. For
example, thoroughly exploring the coaching agreement will undoubtedly inform for
the client, and therefore for the coach, the path the work might take. It also helps to
establish the most appropriate and important path for the work to take and why, as
well as identifying potentially important surrounding circumstances, context or
information which underpin the signiﬁcance of the work for the client.
In addition, thoroughly exploring the coaching agreement will also mean that
bringing the coaching conversation to a point of closure and next steps for the client
will be enhanced by clearly knowing what it was that the client really wanted in the
ﬁrst place. In this way, you can both revisit that agreement to explore how the client
will take this work forward into their life after the session in a way that maximizes
their achievement of their goals and outcomes. Moreover, we will go as far as to say
that a whole coaching session might even usefully be taken up by getting this
foundational work done well, and a coach can evidence all of the core competencies
within that process. Indeed, this is often a differentiator between beginning coaches
and those who are more experienced and effective. Beginners tend to rush to get an
agreement, while more experienced coaches understand the value of full exploration
when developing agreements. Ultimately, our mantra is: don’t rush this!

Coaching Agreements in Depth
Having established the need for thorough exploration of this competency, now let’s
look at some of the detail around how this can be done. The ﬁrst thing I’d like to
highlight here is the use of the words “. . . in the session” when describing certain
aspects of this competency. When a client comes into a coaching session and the
coach asks them what they would like to work on, it is quite possible that the client
will begin to share information about something that they want to happen, achieve or
change etc. “out there” in their life. For example, “I want to improve my relationship
with my team”, “I want to explore my next career move”, “I want to be healthier”.
Not only are these goals quite high level, they are also things that would ultimately
come to fruition outside of the coaching context as part of the client’s daily life.
Having explored and understood what it is that the client wants to achieve “out
there”, our role is to then explore with the client what is the piece of work and the
outcome from that piece of work that they’d like to accomplish in the coaching
session. In this way, we not only know the “out there” goal, we also now know the
goal “in here” for the piece of work that we will do together in the session.
This further exploration of goals not only helps to get clarity on the piece of
coaching work, it also helps the client to really consider what it is that they want to
achieve and work on. It is very interesting how often; through this deeper inquiry the
client may actually change or reframe the goal for the session based on important
insights that may have arisen. If we are working with a client for several sessions, we
may have an overarching goal for the package of work (established in Level 1 or 2)
and then for each individual coaching session there would still be a speciﬁc desired
outcome, the achievement of which takes them incrementally closer toward the
overarching goal.
Another point to note is that, as with any process, sometimes the goal posts
change and sometimes even the goal itself changes. For example, the coach is
expected to notice and inquire if the direction of the conversation seems to have
deviated from the client’s originally stated goal so that there is an opportunity to
check in and either continue, change or realign that direction based upon what is
most important or relevant for the client. The coach might say, “Now that this new
area has emerged, what would be most useful to focus on?” Based upon these
inquiries and check-in opportunities, the coach is then continuing the direction of
the conversation in line with the client’s desired outcome. A notable addition to the
most recent description of this competency is the inclusion of the word “maintains”
agreements. This addition highlights this idea that agreements need to be revisited
throughout the coaching engagement to ensure that they are still relevant to the client
and that the coaching is continuing to move in the desired directions.
Establishing measures of success is also an important aspect of this competency.
Once again, this speciﬁcally relates to getting clarity on those measures of success
for what the client wants to accomplish across the overall coaching engagement
(Level 1 or 2) and then within each coaching session (Level 3). When the coaching
engagement or session ends, how will they know that they have accomplished what
Coaching Agreements in Depth
69

they wanted? This is important for enabling the client to connect with a sense of
achievement and progress. Also, in the case of coaching engagements where there is
a sponsor (e.g. a line manager), it is also a way for the beneﬁt of the coaching to be
measured in terms of establishing a return on investment or a return on expectations
for the work undertaken. As noted in the previous paragraph, there may be a need to
reconﬁrm these measures if the goal or outcome for the session changes.
We then reach the part of this competency concerned with understanding the
importance or meaning of the piece of work for the client and this is useful to
establish for several reasons. This inquiry helps the client to consider their level of
motivation for and conﬁdence or commitment to this topic. Understanding what it
means to them also helps to connect with what difference this would make to them in
their life if the issue were resolved or the goal were achieved. This in turn may
highlight some of the client’s values and the real reasons why this is an important
conversation for them. This inquiry may also inform the clarity of the actual goal for
the coaching session as the client carefully considers what they want and why. This
might be explored with questions such as: “What would it mean to you to resolve or
achieve this?”, “What is important for you in addressing this now?” or “In achieving
this, what would it lead to for you?”
A further point on this competency, the coach is expected to help the client to
consider what might need to be addressed for the session outcome to be successfully
achieved. The analogy we would like to offer for this is planning a trip. We may
decide that we want to travel from one part of the country to another and we look at a
route planner to consider how to get there. However, that planner is showing us a
route and timings based on certain assumptions and averaged criteria. Therefore, do
we simply head off on our way and hope for the best that we’ll get there on time and
with no challenges or interruptions? Or do we check what the weather is due to be
like or if there are any road works or other transport challenges that we might face
etc.? In this same way in coaching, the coach invites the client to consider any issues
that might be relevant to address, consider or explore in service of the client’s
successful accomplishment of their goal.
Finally, establishing and maintaining the coaching agreement is also closely
linked to how the coach partners with the client to effectively manage the time and
bring the session or the overall coaching engagement to an appropriate close. From a
session by session perspective, the coach is expected to partner with the client, not
only to manage the focus of the session as already described, also to manage the time
so that the concept of the conversation having a beginning, middle and end is
achieved. It is the coach’s responsibility to manage the time and to check in with
the client periodically to assess progress toward the stated goal and how the client
would like to use the remaining time available. In this way, the client can focus on
their coaching work and the coach holds the coaching space through carefully
tracking time. This could be evidenced by the coach asking for example:
•
“We’re about half-way through our time today, how are you doing in relation to
your goal for today?”
70
8
Co-creating the Relationship Domain, Competency 3: Establishes and Maintains. . .

•
“We’ve got XYZ minutes left today, where would you like to focus now” or “how
would you like to use the remainder of our time?”
This process of managing time is also relevant for the overall coaching engage-
ment so that progress toward the client’s overarching goals is noted and explored and
any adjustments the client may want to make are addressed.
Ultimately, the coaching engagement will come to an end and an important part
of this competency is that the coach partners with the client to end the coaching
relationship in a way that honors the experience. The key word here is: partners, and
the coach is expected to inquire and co-create an appropriate way of ending,
acknowledging and even celebrating the work and client’s progress and achieve-
ments in the coaching process. This is where the beginning of the work closely
relates to the end of the work and this competency links directly to some aspects of
Competency 8: Facilitates Client Growth.
Conclusion
In this chapter we have highlighted three distinct levels of contracting that coaches
are expected to thoroughly establish and maintain. We have also positioned why
coaching agreements are such a signiﬁcant aspect of the coaching process and have
explored each element of this competency in depth.

Chapter 9
Co-creating the Relationship Domain,
Competency 4. Cultivates Trust and Safety
Introduction
The next competency in this domain is Cultivates Trust and Safety. Whilst this
chapter focuses Competency 4 speciﬁcally, its close relationship with Competency
5: Maintains Presence is signiﬁcant. It is the combination of these two competencies
along with the depth and thoroughness of partnering undertaken in Competency 3:
Establishes and Maintains Agreements, that truly co-creates the relationship with the
client. Whereas the other competencies focus more on how the coach demonstrates
their skills for the actual process of coaching, competencies four and ﬁve particularly
focus on how the coach creates, nurtures, and maintains a good coach-client rela-
tionship to underpin and enable the coaching process to happen most effectively. In
this regard, the word “cultivates” in the title of this competency, is speciﬁcally
intended to reﬂect that trust and safety is something that has to be tended to
throughout the relationship and is not a “one-time activity” by the coach.
Inter-related Competencies
The interrelatedness of all of the competencies will hopefully already be apparent,
however it is worth noting here that competencies four and ﬁve are highly
intertwined with the other competencies and ideally form a thread that runs through
the conversation enabling an environment and a relationship that is conducive to an
effective coaching experience and outcome for the client. Coaching is often
described as a dance, where the coach and client work elegantly together in rapport.
The dance metaphor is a useful one as there are several parallels with coaching in
that the client takes the lead like one partner does in a dance and the fact that at ﬁrst
the dance can feel clunky and we might tread on each other’s feet or start to move in
different directions. We might even feel as though one of us is dancing a waltz whilst

the other is doing the jive! Part of the coach’s skill here therefore is to seek to work
“in-step” with the client as quickly as possible so that the work can be facilitated. For
the purposes of assessment, these skills are to be observed within the coaching
session, however in reality one would expect both of these competencies to be
applied from the very beginning of the coach-client engagement, for example during
a chemistry session.
Moving on to look at Competency 4 speciﬁcally, it is described in Box 9.1.
Box 9.1 Competency 4: Cultivates Trust and Safety Deﬁnition: Partners
with the client to create a safe, supportive environment that allows the client to
share freely. Maintains a relationship of mutual respect and trust.
1. Seeks to understand the client within their context which may include their
identity, environment, experiences, values and beliefs.
2. Demonstrates respect for the client’s identity, perceptions, style and lan-
guage, and adapts one’s coaching to the client.
3. Acknowledges and respects the client’s unique talents, insights, and work
in the coaching process.
4. Shows support, empathy, and concern for the client.
5. Acknowledges and supports the client’s expression of feelings, percep-
tions, concerns, beliefs and suggestions.
6. Demonstrates openness and transparency as a way to display vulnerability
and build trust with the client.
(ICF, 2019b)
Essential Elements
The essential elements of this competency are that the coach:
•
Creates a safe, supportive environment
•
Respects the whole person of the client
•
Acknowledges the work of the client in the process
What is being looked for in this competency is that the coach understands and
respects the client and his or her contribution to their work as well as the coach
creating a safe space for the client to do that work. Given the fact that this
competency is intended to co-create the relationship and be evident throughout the
coaching conversation, there is an expectation that multiple examples of these skills
will be observed during the piece of work. The skills of this competency may be
evidenced directly through the language or actions of the coach and also indirectly
by the coach’s way of being. For example, the friendly exchange of language that
74
9
Co-creating the Relationship Domain, Competency 4. Cultivates Trust and Safety

can occur between the coach and client when they are in rapport and have a
comfortable relationship with each other is a valid way of demonstrating this
competency.
Initially, one would expect to notice the coach seeking to understand their client
better and effectively to get to know them as a person, as well as gaining clarity on
what they are bringing into the coaching process. The focus therefore here is on the
who of the client and not only on what they are bringing. This aspect links to
elements of the previous competency, Establishes and Maintains Agreements,
where the coach may have invited a deeper inquiry as to the signiﬁcance, importance
and timing of the client’s chosen coaching topic. In this way, the coach begins to
know and understand the person bringing the topic as well as the topic itself. In this
competency, the process of relationship building continues with further exploration
of other aspects of the client that may be relevant to the context of the work,
including their associated environment, experiences, values, beliefs, need and expec-
tations and even their sense of their own identity in relation to their topic or goal.
Once the coach and client know each other a little better, the process of acknowl-
edgment and respect is facilitated. Acknowledging and demonstrating respect for the
client’s work in the coaching process might be evidenced by comments such as “You
seem to have given this a lot of thought,” or “It strikes me that you have already put a lot
of effort into this topic.” Supporting the client’s expression could also be noticed
through the coach’s continuing invitation to the client to share their opinion throughout
the coaching session and to say more about their feelings, perceptions, concerns, beliefs
and also their suggestions for how they might move forward. These acknowledgments
and invitations are coupled with respect for the client’s style of expression and language.
At times, the focus of a coaching conversation may enter into areas which may be
quite sensitive for the client. In these cases, this competency also involves the coach
meeting this sensitivity by checking in and seeking permission to further explore or
inquire in that direction. This respectful, sensitive probing which leaves the client at
choice is an important feature in building a strong and safe coach-client connection.
In addition, a good level of respect and rapport might also be experienced by the way
in which the coach appropriately adapts to or matches the client’s way of speaking
and, in the case of face to face coaching, how the coach relates to the client with eye
contact and body language.
Another aspect of acknowledging and respecting the client’s work in the coaching
process is to support, encourage and champion the client’s courage and/or willing-
ness to make changes in service of accomplishing their goal. This might also include
acknowledging the challenges they might face whilst making those changes. This
type of acknowledgement could be evidenced by comments such as, “I know that it
took courage for you to take the risk and do something different,” and “You really
seem to be gaining momentum now with this new habit.” Being aware and inclusive
of the client’s life, history, work, values, beliefs, etc. is yet another way of demon-
strating acknowledgement and respect and can be evidenced by comments such as “I
know how important this is to you and how you have struggled with this in the past. I
now notice how conﬁdently you are working through these situations as they arise.”
It is important to highlight that support, empathy and concern do not mean
rescuing or looking after. A core feature of how these three qualities are evidenced
Essential Elements
75

in coaching is the extent to which the coach creates an equal relationship with the
client and aligns with one of the coaching principles that clients are creative,
resourceful and whole. Therefore, they do not need us to “save” them, “ﬁx” them
or do anything that disempowers them or results in their own sense of resourceful-
ness being limited or undermined in any way. This point also closely relates to a
competency we have already covered in a previous chapter, Competency
2, Embodies a Coaching Mindset.
It is therefore important how acknowledgement is framed and offered so that it is
not positioned as praise or approval from the coach. To illustrate this point, we draw
upon a model from transactional analysis, called Ego States (Stewart & Joines, 2012),
in which the coach seeks to establish an adult-to-adult relationship with the client as
opposed to a parent-child type relationship. To that end, the coach is expected to offer,
when appropriate, empathy versus sympathy, to express conﬁdence in the client’s
capabilities, and to notice the client’s strengths and achievements. The coach should
also demonstrate patience whilst the client is processing their work in the coaching
process and not be judgmental of them or how they are being.
Support that is positioned in this equal, non-judgmental, non-ﬁxing way can be
not only enormously supportive but also very empowering for the client; really
inviting them into a safe space where they can truly tap into their resourcefulness and
creativity to overcome challenges and make the changes they want to make in
service of accomplishing their goals. Examples of this could be, “You can do this.
You have achieved so much already,” “I feel your sadness, how do you want to be
with this right now?” and “Congratulations on making this breakthrough.”
Encouraging and allowing the client to fully express him/herself is another key
aspect to this competency and also another way of demonstrating respect and support as
well as creating a trusting environment. It could also be evidenced in a direct way by the
coach actually asking the client to “Tell me more. . .” or “What are you thinking about
this?” The common theme here is that it is the client who does most of the talking,
without interruption from the coach and the client is also invited to share more when
appropriate in support of forward movement toward their outcome for the session.
Finally, the development of trust and safety is built through the coach demon-
strating openness and transparency as a way to display their own vulnerability. This
could be evidenced by the client being able to agree or disagree with the coach; this
may sound something like, “Tell me if this doesn’t resonate with you, what I notice
is. . .”
Conclusion
In this chapter we have highlighted the inter-related nature of the competencies and,
in this case, the speciﬁc relationship between competencies four and ﬁve. We have
also highlighted and described the essential elements of Cultivating Trust and
Safety. In the next chapter, we will look at the ﬁnal competency that completes the
trilogy in the domain for effectively co-creating the coaching relationship.

Co-creating the Relationship Domain,
Competency 5. Maintains Presence
Introduction
With this competency, we continue to look at how the coach co-creates the relation-
ship with their client and in this case the focus is on the extent to which the coach is
present to and curious about what the client is saying and who the client is. The skill
and quality of this partnering is also signiﬁcant in terms of how and how much the
coach actively seeks input from the client around the content and direction of the
conversation as opposed to offering content and direction themselves.
Maintaining Presence
The competency is described in Box 10.1.
Box 10.1 Competency 5. Maintains Presence Deﬁnition: Is fully con-
scious and present with the client, employing a style that is open, ﬂexible,
grounded and conﬁdent.
1. Remains focused, observant, empathetic and responsive to the client.
2. Demonstrates curiosity during the coaching process.
3. Manages one’s emotions to stay present with the client.
4. Demonstrates conﬁdence in working with strong client emotions during the
coaching process.
5. Is comfortable working in a space of not knowing.
6. Creates and allows for silence, pause or reﬂection.

Essential Elements
Essential elements of this competency are that the coach:
•
Maintains full focus on the client
•
Demonstrates curiosity
•
Manages emotions
•
Creates space for reﬂection
Presence is exempliﬁed in the ﬁrst sub-competency by the coach being able to
remain focused, observant, empathetic and responsive to the client. The following
sub-competencies then offer examples of how the coach can demonstrate the quality
of presence. Some key themes at the heart of this competency are the extent to which
the coach truly partners with their client, staying grounded and open, even when
faced with challenge, complexity and uncertainty, and the extent to which the coach
works with the client beyond their coaching topic. Sometimes this is called
“coaching the person” and not just the topic. Partnering has already been positioned
as critical within the competencies covered so far and it is this focus on partnering
that enables some signiﬁcant qualities of a highly effective coaching conversation.
Partnering
Here are the key elements of partnering which are embedded within the philosophy
of this competency:
•
Shows respect and equality
•
Engenders trust and safety
•
Empowers the client
•
Helps to hold the client accountable for the work in the coaching process (see
more on accountability in Chap. 13)
•
Underpins autonomous and developmental thinking and positive change for the
client
In practice, the coach can demonstrate this partnering in several ways. Firstly, it
can be evidenced by the coach inviting the client to co-design the focus and direction
of the session with comments such as “Where would you like to start?”, “How would
you like to approach this?”, “Where would you like to go next?” and “How can I best
work with you today around this topic?” Partnering is also experienced when the
coach is open to and invites the client to disagree with the coach. This could be
through the coach comfortably moving from their own frame of reference to that of
the client, for example: “What my intuition says is. . . . however, I may be wrong,
what do you think about. . .?” This invitation to disagree could also be demonstrated
by the coach, if offering their perspective, doing so without attachment such as:”
What is your reaction to what I just offered and please feel free to disagree with it.”
Another aspect of partnering is when the coach plays back options or possibilities
the client has expressed and invites them to choose what they would like to do with
78
10
Co-creating the Relationship Domain, Competency 5. Maintains Presence

them. What is signiﬁcant here is that the client has agency and is the one who, not only
sets the agenda, also sets the direction and approach the work will take in the coaching
process. For example, the client might share several options for what they would like
to move forwards with after the session and the coach may play them back by
paraphrasing and clarifying their understanding and then inviting the client to choose
which direction is going to be of most use to the client. This might be something like;
“You have outlined options A, B and C, what do you want to do?” This approach is
also helpful if the client brings several possible coaching topics into the session.
Additionally, this play back is useful if and when the client might be exploring
possibilities that could potentially be in conﬂict, not fully aligned or are very different,
for example: “I’m hearing that you want to take a 6-month break and you are also
intrigued by this new project: what would be most fulﬁlling for you at this time?”
Coaching is intended to support client’s growth and development beyond the
coaching conversations and beyond the speciﬁc topics they bring into coaching and
partnering with them is one of the keys to unlocking that growth and potential.
Speciﬁcally, the coach can enable this by encouraging the client to formulate his or
her own learning as opposed to doing it for them. In this way, the coach champions
the client’s capability to assess their own experience by asking questions like: “What
do you notice as you describe that situation?” and “What does that tell you?” or
“What are you learning as you hear yourself describe that experience?”
Coach the Person
Now let’s look at the other key aspect of this competency, which is “coaching the
person.” At an ACC level of coaching the coach is likely to hold a focus that is limited to
the topic that the clients bring in to coaching. At PCC and even more so at MCC level,
there is an expectation that the coach will not only hold and work with the client’s topic,
they will also focus on how the client thinks, feels, learns, relates and creates. This might
also extend to the client’s values and beliefs, how they view the world and how they see
or want to be their place in the word. For example, the coach might ask: “How might
this new project align with the values you shared earlier?” or “What are the beliefs and
values that you will honor when you have that conversation?”
When coaching the person, the coach is also demonstrating empathy and respon-
siveness and showing they are fully observant to what is happening in the coaching
process. This could be noticing and inquiring about client emotions or feelings such
as: “I’m sensing some disappointment and I’d like to check . . . how is this for you?”
or “I can see your emotion and I know this is important for you, would you like to
explore this further?” This brings us to the topic of the client’s emotions and in
particular strong emotions. The coach is expected to be able to appropriately hold the
space for the client to fully express themselves and this may include expressing a
strong emotion. This links back to the philosophy that we hold of the client being
creative, resourceful and whole. A client expressing emotions, for example crying,
does not necessarily become un-resourceful, lacking in creativity or broken! Rogers
Coach the Person
79

(1980) stated: “I regret it when I suppress my feelings too long and they burst forth in
ways that are distorted or attacking or hurtful”. Part of what coaching can offer is a
place for emotions to be expressed and explored in service of forward movement and
growth. It is therefore important that the coach can offer a space for it to be okay for
emotions to be expressed. To illustrate this, we make reference to a concept called
Life Positions originating from the work of Eric Berne (1962), who founded a
psychological approach called transactional analysis. Aspects of Berne’s work
were further developed by Franklin Ernst (1971), positioning a model called the
OK Corral. In this model, there is a healthy and functional position where both the
coach and the client hold the perspective of: “I am OK with me and you are OK with
me”. This means that, whilst the client may be emotional or tearful, they are still OK
at their core and the coach and the client can still get on with the coaching work at
hand as opposed to the coach assuming that the client needs to stop or indeed that the
coach needs to stop because of the emotions that are present at that time. This aspect
of working with emotions is very natural and comfortable for some coaches and less
so for others and in this case an opportunity for valuable growth for the coach might
be in exploring this aspect of their work and their own responses to emotions in
others. This links directly to sub-competency 3: “Manages one’s emotions to stay
present with the client” and also to many aspects of Competency 2: Embodies a
Coaching Mindset.
Another way to coach the person as well as the topic thereby demonstrating that
we are focused, observant and responsive is by exhibiting curiosity with the inten-
tion to learn more about the client. Curiosity is shown by the coach genuinely
inquiring about the client’s agenda and aspects of the client as a person as well as
regularly seeking input from the client around their ideas and perspectives.
It is also relevant at this point to state that coaching is not therapy and there may
be a time when the client’s level and nature of emotion indicates that another form of
resource might be more appropriate and useful to the client. This is referenced in the
ICF Code of Ethics Part 4. Ethical Standards, Section I—Responsibility to clients,
item 7: Remain alert to indications that there might be a shift in the value received
from the coaching relationship. If so, make a change in the relationship or encour-
age the Client(s)/Sponsor(s) to seek another coach, seek another professional or use
a different resource. As previously outlined in Chapter 6, guidance on when and
how to refer clients to therapy can be found in an ICF white paper called “Referring a
Client to Therapy” (Hullinger & DiGirolamo, 2018).
Getting in the Way
Sometimes the coach’s presence is noticeable in its absence. The absence or reduc-
tion of our presence with our client may be due to certain factors, one of which might
be strong client emotions which we have just explored. Another factor that can
challenge our presence is the need to know. In so many walks of life, what we know
seems to be important, we are conditioned and encouraged to know and we are, in
many circumstances, valued by what we know. Academics, subject matter experts
80
10
Co-creating the Relationship Domain, Competency 5. Maintains Presence

and specialists are paid because of what they know. Leaders are supposed to know
what to do during organizational change, doctors are expected to know what is
wrong with their patients. However, if we consider the humanistic approach (see
Chap. 16), it may be that our knowledge can in fact be a distraction and even get in
the way of the client being able to do their own work.
The humanistic approach embraces the belief that people have a “self-righting
reﬂex” and, given the right conditions, will be able to achieve their goal. A new coach
may struggle with this concept as it is often quite a signiﬁcant mindset shift from the
social conditioning we have experienced around knowledge in other aspects of our
lives. It can feel almost counter intuitive to think that we add value by not knowing.
As we develop in our coaching practice, we come to realize that we do not know
exactly what is going on for our client or indeed ultimately what is best for them, not
is it our role to do so. They are the subject matter expert on their life and our role is to
be comfortable to be with them as they navigate their unknown, not trying to solve or
ﬁx, simply to create and offer them the space and time to think, being utterly present,
deeply listening and supporting their thinking and feeling process with some clean
and simple, yet thought provoking questions and observations. This challenge could
be exempliﬁed by considering a person who has had a successful career in their ﬁeld
and decides to leave corporate life and become a coach. Whilst they clearly grasp the
theory of coaching and understand the competencies on paper, what can be noticeable
is that, in their coaching practice, they simply cannot resist the desire or even the need
to offer, to suggest, to ﬁx, to drive, to direct. Their conditioning from years of being
valued for they know in their professional career and their own perception of they add
value that can be tied up and intertwined with that conditioning. This can mean that
the coach’s own agenda and beliefs begin to seep into the work and in fact have the
opposite effect of adding value as they end up getting in the client’s way. We have
heard many new coaches say things like: “I didn’t do anything”, “I’m just not sure
how I added value really”, “I’m struggling to help my clients get to their goal” or even
“How can just listening help them? Surely, I need to give them something, otherwise
what value am I being to them . . . and they are paying me for that!”
This shift in our own mindset is also closely linked to coach maturity which we
have explored in Chap. 1. Developing the capacity to be comfortable with not
knowing may also involve therefore some personal work (perhaps with our own
coach or a coaching supervisor) for us to explore our own beliefs about knowing and
what it means for us to know, not know and how we perceive ourselves to have value
as a coach. As coaches, our value can be enormous, it may be more a question of how
we deﬁne and perceive that value.
Silence Is Golden
As noted above, this competency also addresses the extent to which the coach creates
or allows space for silence, pause or reﬂection. This is an important aspect of the
client being able to fully express themselves and for them to freely engage in the
thinking and feeling processes needed for that fullness of expression. This space, the
Silence Is Golden
81

“coaching space”, is what then facilitates the client being able to make meaning of
their thoughts and feelings. This meaning-making process links very closely to
Competencies 7, Evokes Awareness and 8, Facilitates Client Growth. Space for
the client could be encouraged simply by the coach staying quiet and allowing the
client to share and pause and then share more as their thoughts unfold and come to
the surface. By way of illustration, we draw up on the comparison to a game of table
tennis. In table tennis, we hear the constant tap, tap, tap, tap as each player hits the
ball and passes it back over to the other side. Often when people are ﬁrst learning to
coach, the conversation sounds a little like this as the dialogue is exchanged between
the coach and client through a stream of questions and answers with very little space
in between. One of the things that we know about how we process information and
communicate best, is that it is the space in between the dialogue that makes the
difference. It is during that space that the words which have just been spoken are
truly listened to, rather than just heard. It is also in that “coaching space” that we
digest and process the words and begin to formulate our response. What is noticeable
in coaching conversations with more experienced coaches is that the “game” slows
down, it’s almost as though the table tennis ball becomes momentarily suspended in
the air somewhere between the two players before it lands, and the other person
speaks again. In this way, the client has the space to really hear themselves and gain
insights from their own expression and the coach has the space to truly listen to their
client and then take the time to consider what to say or ask next based upon what
they are hearing, noticing and experiencing in the coaching process.
It is important for the coach to give the client sufﬁcient time for reﬂection, time to
answer questions and simply to just give them time to think (Kline, 1999). Kline
proposes that the quality of someone’s thinking is directly comparable to the quality
of the listening they receive. All too often, coaches feel that they have to add value
by asking great questions or offering some powerful insight and can therefore get
caught up in their own agenda and desire for performance when all the client might
need is the space and time to think for themselves and be deeply heard and listened
to. This is an important part of how the partnership and the dance between coach and
client can be almost magical in inviting the client’s own wisdom to come forward.
Conclusion
This chapter concludes the trilogy of competencies that describes the domain of Co-
Creating the Relationship. We have highlighted and outlined the importance of
partnering and the concept of coaching the person and not just the topic. We have
also explored some of the things that can get in the way of the coach fully
demonstrating this competency and ended with one of the most powerful coaching
interventions: silence.

On reading this description, you may notice that there are some themes here
which have already been introduced in the competencies covered so far:
•
The client’s broader context
•
Seeking and listening to understand
•
Probing and integrating client’s way of communicating for greater clarity and
depth of meaning
•
Noticing and exploring voice, verbal language, energy, and body language
•
Playing back
•
Noticing and exploring trends, themes and patterns
The above themes also form a thread that is intended to run through the coaching
conversation in a natural, intuitive, and appropriate way.
Key Elements
The key elements of this competency are that the coach:
1. Engages in holistic listening
2. Reﬂects back to ensure shared understanding
3. Integrates understanding of the client to support communication
In essence this competency is about the coach’s ability to truly hear what the
client is presenting about who s/he is and the client’s situation or coaching topic.
This ability is evidenced by how the coach responds to what the client presents and
how the coach uses the information and language shared by the client to co-create a
structure and direction for the conversation including potential areas of exploration.
At a basic level this implies all of the great active listening skills that we know
well: actively demonstrating attention, showing genuine interest, paraphrasing,
summarizing, mirroring, seeking clarity, encouraging the client to share, withhold-
ing judgment, and refraining from pushing their own ideas and agenda. Over and
above these skills, we then add another layer of listening that engages both the client
and the coach in a deeper exploration of the meaning of what is being presented,
which offers greater insight and awareness in service of the client’s forward
movement.
Listening Through Questioning and Inquiry
One of the ways to initiate this deeper listening is by asking questions or making
observations that are truly reﬂective of what the coach knows about the client and
their situation or topic. This may appear to be a very obvious suggestion; however, it
is not always so easy to do in practice. It can be very easy for the coach to ﬁnd
themselves in a place where they have a question they want to ask, and the client is
84
11
Communicating Effectively Domain, Competency 6. Listens Actively

still talking. The coach’s energy then becomes focused on waiting for the client to
stop so that they can ask their question. I have heard this called “question queuing”
and it is something that takes the coach’s energy, attention and presence away from
listening to their client because they are more focused on their own agenda of asking
their question. Many times, whilst listening to recordings of coaching sessions, we
have even heard the intake of breath by the coach, literally waiting for the client to
ﬁnish so that they can allow their question to come out. This creates a very different
environment for the client to work in compared to the one that allowed for space for
the client to fully express themselves as described in the previous chapter on
competency ﬁve. Offering questions or observations that are reﬂective of what we
have learnt about the client are also evidenced when we draw upon information that
we heard from them previously, for example: “In our last session you mentioned
how important rest was for you at the moment, what is the impact of this new project
on that?” In this way, the coach “notices trends in the client’s behavior and emotions
across sessions to discern themes and patterns”. This is important to reinforce as
using cumulative information from listening across sessions is how the coach can
come to understand the broader context and full meanings of what the client is
saying. This deeper, broader aspect of listening is sometimes overlooked by less
experienced coaches and is also one which, once developed, helps the coach to build
and maintain their coaching presence with the client.
Deeper listening also involves deeper inquiry. This inquiry might be about the
client’s use of language and/or the client’s feelings, patterns the coach has noticed as
well as how the client processes. For example, for language, the coach might ask:
“You have mentioned freedom a few times, what does freedom mean to you?” and
for feelings the coach might ask: “How do you feel when you think about that
freedom?” and for a deeper inquiry into how the client processes it could be
something like: “How will honoring your value of freedom support you in achieving
your goal?” Inquiry into client’s emotions can also link to some of the points
discussed in competency ﬁve around working with client emotions. For example,
the coach might ask about or reﬂect back the client’s emotions by noticing their
mood, tone, body language, energy etc. In this instance, the coach could ask: “When
you talk about this, your face lights up and you smile broadly, what does this mean
for you?” or “I notice your tears, what’s going on for you right now?”
Assumptions
What is also important about this is that it helps the coach to check and take care with
their own possible assumptions about what the client is saying. When a client
mentions “freedom”, it can be very quick and easy for the coach’s own mind to go
directly to what freedom means for them as so often we process what someone else is
saying by using ourselves and our own lives and experiences as a point of reference.
In coaching, the danger with this is that we may then act upon those assumptions and
what freedom means to the coach may be very different to what it means for their
client. Whilst we may think we are speaking the same language, in fact we are not,

because everyone has their own unique way of choosing words and terms to
accurately express the real meaning of our thoughts and feelings. The care we take
when choosing our words can be exempliﬁed when we at times struggle to “ﬁnd the
right words” and so it is really important that the coach carefully listens to the words
their clients share as they will have been chosen for a reason—the term “words create
worlds” comes to mind.
Listening with All the Senses
Noticing and exploring energy shifts is a powerful way to invite deeper listening and
communication with the client. There would need to be a noticeable shift in
the client’s energy for this to be relevant of course. However, what is expected is
that the coach is demonstrating their presence by sharing observational feedback
with the client when the client’s body, physical rhythms or posture change. A further
nuance to this level of inquiry is to ask about or explore the client’s tone of voice,
pace or volume of speech and other changes to vocal qualities. As with energy shifts,
changes in the client’s vocal qualities are a way for us to demonstrate our deeper
level of listening through observational feedback. For example: “When you talk
about that event your speech speeds up quite a bit and your voice gets higher, what
do you think that is about?”
Finally, in addition to listening for and inquiring about language, feelings and
voice qualities, the coach may also listen for and inquire about the client’s behaviors
and also how the client perceives his/her world in terms of their environment, beliefs
and values etc. For instance, the client may share a particular situation and the coach
might further explore this by inquiring about the client’s actions, reactions and/or
responses to people, places and events. What is noteworthy here is that these
questions are not intended to simply elicit data, e.g. what did he do and what did
you do and then what did he do? The focus of the coach should be on exploring the
process that was happening before, during or after certain behaviors, for example:
“What were your thoughts and feelings that led you to react in that way?” or “What
was the impact of your actions in that meeting?” or “How do you want to be when
you have that conversation?” How the client perceives his or her experience can be
explored by inquiring about the client’s beliefs, assumptions, values and perspec-
tives, such as: “What assumptions might you be making about this?” or “From where
you stand, what is your perspective?” or “What is your belief about this?”
Conclusion
What is evident in this chapter is that listening involves questioning. Listening in the
coaching relationship is not a passive activity, we listen actively. Our listening as a
coach has a purpose and this means asking questions to probe, inquire and explore so
that the true meaning of what the client is communicating is fully expressed,
conveyed, and understood.

Competency 7. Evokes Awareness
Introduction
The second of the two competencies concerned with the effective communication of
the coach is Evokes Awareness. The competency and job analysis process identiﬁed
and analyzed certain “kernels” that emerged as highly effective characteristics in the
coaching process. These included:
•
The client being open to change or learning
•
The coach listening to the client
•
The coach utilizing appropriate coaching methods and approaches to cause the
client to shift
This competency is described in Box 12.1.
Box 12.1 Competency 7: Evokes Awareness Deﬁnition: Facilitates client
insight and learning by using tools and techniques such as powerful
questioning, silence, metaphor or analogy.
1. Considers client experience when deciding what might be most useful.
2. Challenges the client as a way to evoke awareness or insight.

The key elements of this competency are that the coach:

•
Shares observations to support new learning

Supports the client in reﬂection and reframing
What Is a ‘Powerful Question’?
We start by looking at powerful questioning as an important coaching tool which
causes the client to shift. Sometimes coaches think that a powerful question is one
that “blows the socks off the client” because of its power. To understand what
constitutes a powerful question, we point our attention toward the ICF deﬁnition of
coaching: “Partnering with clients in a thought-provoking and creative process that
inspires them to maximize their personal and professional potential” (ICF, 2007).
The tool of powerful questioning relates directly to the “thought-provoking” part
of this deﬁnition. We know that we are typically creatures of habit and that our habits
extend to thinking habits as well as behavioral ones. There is a saying of disputed
origin: “If you always do what you’ve always done, you’ll always get what you’ve
always got” and this really underpins the relevance of this tool in coaching. If the
client’s current behavioral and thinking habits were working well for them in the
situation they have brought into coaching, they probably would not need or want
coaching on it. The very fact that they have brought this topic means that they are
most likely experiencing some sort of challenge or complexity around it that would
be supported by expanding their thinking, their perspectives and therefore the
choices they feel they have in that situation. This is the function and purpose of
this tool; not to “blow the client’s socks off”, rather to be able to ask clear questions
that help the client to explore issues, his/her part in those issues, their behaviors and
how they are being. These questions are intended to help the client to move forward
toward his/her desired outcome for the coaching conversation.
There are some common patterns in the effective use of powerful questioning
including the focus or types of questions that can be asked, the nature and quality of
those questions and the purpose of powerful questions.

Communicating Effectively Domain, Competency 7. Evokes Awareness

Focus and Type of Questions
Taking the focus or type of questions ﬁrst, words like: evoke, explore, beyond,
generate and reframe are noticeable. Therefore, the types of questions that are
powerful are those which challenge the client and their thinking and invite them to
go beyond the boundaries and limitations of their habitual thinking habits to explore
and discover new ways of considering their situation, issue or goal. This can be done
in several ways; the coach can ask questions about the client’s way of thinking, their
assumptions beliefs, values, wants and needs etc. For example: “What choices have
you considered so far?”, “What is important for you about that?”, “What assump-
tions are you making about this situation?”, “What will you consider to make a
decision?” and “What do you really want?”. These expansive questions might also
focus on inviting the client to consider new ways of thinking about him/herself and
even challenge their current thinking so that they can see the situation from a
different angle. In this way, the coach’s questions invite the client to move away
from their current “story” and look forward toward new and different possibilities.
This can be demonstrated by questions such as: “Is that belief really true?”, “How
could you challenge your view about this?” or “How might you think differently
about yourself in this situation?”
Apart from exploring the client’s thinking and how they view themselves,
powerful questions can also focus on expanding their awareness around the situation
they are bringing into coaching. With these types of questions, the coach is inviting
the client to look at the situation from different perspectives. The questions are
intended to support the client to reframe the situation to one which is more
empowering for them and could be evidenced by questions such as: “If it were
6 months from now and this were resolved what do you notice?”, “What is a different
way of looking at this?”, “What do you notice when you put yourself in their shoes?”
and “What else?” Finally, it is also important for the coach’s questions to invite the
client to direct their attention and thinking toward their goal. Here, the coach is
inviting an inquiry of what success might look like and asks the client to imagine
their desired future. This may also include working with time by inviting an inquiry
that starts from the future and works backwards to the present moment. These
questions assist the client to create new scenarios and possibilities that would enable
and lead to the successful accomplishment of their goal. Examples of these types of
questions might be: “How do you want things to be in a year from now?”, “What
would the ideal outcome look like for you?”, “What could you change today that will
move you closer to that goal?” and the “miracle question”: “What if you had a magic
wand, what would you change?” The miracle question can be very useful as it
directly challenges the limitations imposed by habitual thinking. Sometimes, some-
thing is only impossible because of the way we are thinking about it and, once our
thinking is unlocked through these powerful questions, so many more options and
possibilities become available to us.
As seen above, the focus on future and what is possible also links closely to the
client’s ideal view of self. A question such as: “What if anything were possible?”
Focus and Type of Questions
89

speaks very much to the concept of the exploration of fantasy life outlined in
Chap. 21 and the psychodynamic approach. Boyatzis’s Intentional Change Theory
(2008) and the discovery of the “Ideal Self” also reinforces a focus on the beneﬁts of
exploring the client’s hopes, dreams and vision of success to open up the scope for
what is possible in the client’s thinking.
Future focus is at the core of the forward-moving philosophy of coaching.
Whereas the competency of Listens Actively (see Chap. 11) focuses a great deal
on listening to the client and their current view of the world, their situation and their
view of self, the competency of Evokes Awareness is much more about shifting that
view into what may be possible. Questions are important for both of these compe-
tencies; however, the intentions and outcomes for each are distinct.
As we discuss these different types of questions, we refer back once again to the
ICF deﬁnition of coaching:
“Partnering with clients in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires
them to maximize their personal and professional potential” (ICF, 2007).
By provoking new and expanded thought, the coach is able to support the client to
access their innate creativity, something which may have been left dormant or
impeded by the previous thinking habits. To that end, the role of the coach goes
beyond being someone who asks “powerful” questions to the essential idea of the
coach helping the client gain new insights. Once their creativity is unlocked and the
client can see more options, possibilities and choices, their energy can then be more
positively directed toward the accomplishment of their goals, leaving them feeling
more inspired and fulﬁlled.
Nature and Quality of Questions
Moving to the nature and quality of the coach’s questions, these are intended to be as
clear and concise as possible. Through conciseness, the client can hear and process
the question more easily, meaning that their mental energy is being maximized and
not distracted by complicated, lengthy questions that take time and energy to
understand, let alone process and respond. This is further supported by the coach’s
questions being primarily open ended, asked one at a time, rather than multiple
questions, and at a pace that allows the client time to listen, think, reﬂect and respond
(remember, this isn’t a game of table tennis!). The acronym: WAIT (Why am I
talking?) is helpful here to remind the coach that their questions are intended to
evoke new thought, not interrupt or demonstrate own performance or agenda and so
the philosophy of “less is more” is deﬁnitely advocated and the coach is encouraged
to take their own time to reﬂect so that they can carefully consider, formulate and ask
their questions in as few words as possible for maximum positive impact for the
client.
The quality of the coach’s questions will also be enhanced by using and appro-
priately mirroring the client’s language and elements of the client’s learning style
and frame of reference. As with many aspects of building connection and rapport
90
12
Communicating Effectively Domain, Competency 7. Evokes Awareness

that we have already seen in some of the previous competencies, the use of the
client’s language allows for mirror neurons to be triggered which, not only nurture
that rapport, create a level of familiarity for the client, which enables them to connect
with and process that language more readily. Questions being clear, concise and
using the client’s language are qualities that Nancy Kline (1999) notes when
describing incisive questions which we have covered further in Chap. 16 on the
humanistic approach.
The coach is also expected to consider the client’s experience, context and
communication style in order to understand and notice what is working so that
they can then adapt and work with the client’s style. This may be learning by doing,
reﬂecting, experimenting, visualizing etc. For example, the coach might ask: “You
mentioned that you had caught a glimpse of that future, what can you see?”, “How
would you like to approach this part of the work?”, “What would you like to do
now?” and “You said you are ﬁring on all cylinders, what is that like?” A ﬁnal note
on the quality of the coach’s questions is that they are not leading and do not contain
a conclusion or direction from the coach. This aspect is a clear way of demonstrating
the extent to which the coach is keeping to and holding the client’s agenda versus
their own and is evidenced with questions such as: “From the options you have
outlined, which path do you want to take?”, “What ideas do you have?” and “What
conclusions are you drawing from this?”
The Purpose of Powerful Questioning
Ultimately, the purpose of powerful questioning is to support the client to explore
new and different thinking that equally opens up new and different options, possi-
bilities and choice, supporting the client to be more empowered to make those
choices and take steps toward accomplishing their goal. What is important to
remember however is that these questions need to be customized by what we have
heard and learnt about the client and their situations. Whilst several examples of
questions are being suggested within the chapters of this section, we offer a strong
caution against thinking about these questions as a list of options. Every coaching
conversation is different and unique and the very best way to ask a powerful question
is to be deeply connected to the client and the conversation; to be fully present, to
listen with all of the senses, to be intuitive and ask questions that arise directly from
what is being heard and learnt in the coaching process. Formulaic coaching is in
itself a habit, a thinking and behavioral habit, and is the very thing that we are
inviting our clients to do differently.
The Purpose of Powerful Questioning
91

Metaphor
Now let us consider another signiﬁcant and useful tool in coaching for evoking
awareness: the use of metaphor and/or analogy, which is a way of working with the
client’s language to create the relationship, communicate effectively and evoke
awareness. One of the roots of this word is: metapherein, which means “to carry
over,” i.e. to transfer meaning and metaphor is an important way that we give
meaning and structure to what we say. Whilst our speech may be structured,
measured and logical, our mind and thoughts are more random, fast and multifac-
eted. Language is therefore used to express what is going on inside and metaphor is
used to share how we give meaning to our experience. Working with the client’s
shared metaphor(s) is a rich way to communicate and engage with the client to more
deeply understand what something truly means to them. Imagine the question “How
are you?” . . .what is evoked if the answer is: “I’m on Cloud 9” or “I feel like I’m
trapped in a dark cave and I can’t ﬁnd my way out”? These metaphors and symbolic
language offer an opportunity to draw upon great coaching skills and inquire about
the client’s use of language and what it means for them, all customized by what we
have heard through deep presence and listening.
Silence
Silence is also noted as a really useful way to evoke awareness and once again, the
inter-relatedness of the competencies is evident. The coach’s ability to allow silence
and space, to pause for reﬂection, consideration and meaning making, offer a
powerful opportunity for expansion of the client’s awareness. As such, silence is
also highlighted and covered more fully in Chap. 10, competency 5: Maintains
Presence.
Finding Potential
Another aspect of this competency is the extent to which the coach’s questions,
intuitions and observations have the potential to create new learning for their client.
The key word here is potential to create. . .a coach cannot guarantee that the client
will take learning, however the role of the coach in this competency is to offer
contributions that have the potential for this learning to be evoked. Indeed, this is one
of the places in coaching where the coach may in fact offer occasional mentoring or
consultancy type interventions by sharing their own ideas to evoke insight and
forward movement (and always in service of the client’s agenda as opposed to
indulging the agenda or ego of the coach). For example, “May I share my perspective
on this? Please let me know if it’s helpful or if you disagree”, “I think of you as a
92
12
Communicating Effectively Domain, Competency 7. Evokes Awareness

highly creative thinker, what happens when you think of yourself that way too?” or
“You appear to be limiting your options here, what do you think?”
Offering Perspectives
Part of this activity may include the coach sharing observations, insights, and
feelings, without attachment, that have the potential to create new learning for the
client. The idea of coaches giving advice is always a controversial topic. We know
from years of anecdotal evidence and listening to recordings of coaching sessions
that many coaches do this—and frequently with positive results. Evidence of this
was seen at all stages of the competency and job analysis process and two important
criteria have been identiﬁed:
1. It is acceptable to share observations, insights or feelings with clients after getting
permission to do so as long as there is no attachment to it.
2. The sharing must broaden (rather than narrow) the range of options or view for
the client.
Therefore, such interventions by the coach are expected to be in service of the
client’s forward movement or learning—not the coach’s agenda. This means that the
interventions seek to expand and explore the client’s thinking; potentially challenge
the client’s thinking and support the client to have new and different ways of
considering and interacting with their issue. This type of intervention means that
the coach is described as being “unattached” to their offering and is communicating
in a way that enables self-discovery for the client as opposed to the coach telling the
client on the basis of the coach holding a sense of being right or “knowing” what the
client needs. Such unattached observations, intuitions, comments, thoughts and
feelings might be something like: “It sounds like you are much more satisﬁed with
that solution”, “I’m hearing disappointment, is that right?” or “My intuition is telling
me there’s still something missing for you, how are you feeling about it?”
Conclusion
This competency is pivotal to the changes the client makes in their thinking, feeling
and behavior, that ultimately lead them closer to their goals and desired outcomes.
The process of evoking awareness includes careful questioning, probing and explo-
ration as well the well placed offering of perspectives and observations from the
coach that are in service of the client’s learning and forward movement. The
effective coach notices what is working in the coaching process and adapts to
work ‘in-step’ with their client, which can include working with metaphor and
silence in order to elicit the client’s full potential for growth and development.

Cultivating Learning and Growth Domain,
Competency 8: Facilitates Client Growth
Introduction
This ﬁnal competency sits under the domain of Cultivating Learning and Growth
and epitomizes the overarching function and purpose of the coaching process. The
speciﬁc use of the words learning and growth immediately tells us that coaching is
not just about solving a problem, working on an issue, reaching a goal, or addressing
a challenge. It is about much more than that. On one level, it is about using the
coaching process to work with what the client brings into the session in order to
establish speciﬁc, positive, and forward-moving outcomes. On another level,
coaching focuses on how the client can nurture and fully leverage their experience
of addressing their topic in a way that maximizes their personal and professional
potential in a much broader sense. In this way, coaching most deﬁnitely has a micro
and macro level of focus in many ways (see Table 13.1). This competency is
described in Box 13.1.
Key Elements
The key elements of this competency are that the coach:
•
Facilitates learning into action
•
Respects client autonomy
•
Celebrates progress
•
Partners to close the session
Having supported the client to achieve expanded thinking and greater awareness
in the previous competency, the essence of this competency is focused on how the
client is then invited to consider what learning and insights they are drawing from
their work in the coaching process and how that might be applied and integrated for

their beneﬁt beyond the coaching conversation. In simple terms, this is about how
the coach helps the client leverage their enhanced awareness, thereby facilitating
growth as a result. Furthermore, the forward movement implied in the coaching
process means that this competency also focuses on next steps and their associated
planning and implementation.
Box 13.1 Competency 8: Facilitates Client Growth
Deﬁnition: Partners with the client to transform learning and insight into
action. Promotes client autonomy in the coaching process.

Autonomous Learning
What is being looked for and evaluated in this competency is the coach’s ability to
promote client autonomy and let them create, claim and determine how to use new
learning arising from the coaching conversation (and across the coaching process).
There is also a focus on how the coach partners with the client to create the potential
for that new learning and growth to take place.
Part of this might include the coach inviting the client to explore the learning they
are gaining from the session about their coaching topic or issue, such as: “Having
explored this topic today, what are you learning about the situation?” However, in
the spirit of not wishing to become formulaic in our coaching style, coaches are
encouraged to draw upon many other ways to offer this type of inquiry. For example,
“What insights are you gaining about. . .?”, “What conclusions are you drawing
about. . .?” or “What is changing now that you have explored this further?” This type
of inquiry might also be about the learning the client is gaining about themselves and
how they might behave differently as a result or how they perceive themselves now
in their situation, such as: “What have you learnt about yourself as a leader today?”,
“What will you do differently now that you have made these decisions?” or “How
will your insights impact the way you want to be as a parent?”
Eliciting, Integrating and Applying Learning
This competency also attends to how the coach invites the client to explore beyond
the learning around their speciﬁc coaching issue or topic within the session to their
broader environment and to their goal “out there” in their life (from micro to macro).
Thus, this competency really opens up the possibility for the coaching work and
process to offer growth and development opportunities to the client that are focused
on them as a person and not limited to the resolution of their issue. Such broader
learning and its application might be explored by the coach asking questions like:
“Where else might this insight be of use to you?”, “How might you apply this
learning more broadly?” or “How are you going to use the learning from today in
your intention to be more proactive at work?”
In addition to these learning inquiry questions; the coach may facilitate growth by
offering their own observations about the client or the client’s situation and
partnering with them by seeking the client’s further input or exploration. This
could be offered at relevant points throughout the session and might be by noticing
and inquiring about tone of voice, body language, emotions or patterns of thought
and language. For example, “I notice that your shoulders dropped, and you sighed
heavily when you said that, what is that about?” or “I notice you talking much more
conﬁdently about this today, what is different?”
In essence, what is important in this competency is that the coach explores and
invites an inquiry about learning, insights, conclusions and decisions etc. This is
Eliciting, Integrating and Applying Learning
97

done without attachment and in a way that evokes self-discovery for the client and
not telling or teaching by the coach. In this way, the client is more naturally propelled
to a place of forward movement as a result of the learning and this facilitates a
conversation about next steps after the session.
An important point to note here is that, whilst this is the ﬁnal competency, the
process of partnering and inquiry that facilitates learning and growth does not
necessarily have to show up only at the end of the coaching conversation. Insights,
learning, awareness, observations and decisions etc. might naturally surface at any
point within the coaching conversation.
What Next?
The process of establishing learning, insights, conclusions and decisions etc. natu-
rally lends itself to a focus on next steps. This competency therefore also addresses
how the coach brings the coaching session (and potentially the overall coaching
engagement) to a close in a way that is meaningful and forward moving for the
client. We spoke in Chap. 7 about a good coaching session having a beginning, a
middle, and an end. We might even think about this as forming a third, a third and
third of the time for the session. Now, in reality, the middle is likely to be more than a
third of the session, however it does highlight the importance of not underestimating
the time needed to thoroughly work with the client on the beginning and the end
aspects of their work. So often, these two aspects are squeezed into the ﬁrst and last
2 min of the coaching session when in fact they offer the opportunity for signiﬁcant
insight and progress for the client when done well. Having set a strong and thorough
foundation to the work at the beginning of session (and the overall coaching
engagement) will help to facilitate bringing the session (or the overall coaching
engagement) to closure and it is that closure which we will now explore.
In essence, what is expected in this competency is that the coach assists the client
to apply and carry forward the results of the coaching session. An important part of
enabling the results to be carried forward is by the coach inquiring about the client’s
progress toward their goal. This may be done intermittently, for example: “We are
about half way through the session now, how are we doing in terms of progress
toward what you wanted to take from this session today?” and also in a speciﬁc way,
such as “At the beginning you said your motivation was at 4 out of 10, and you
wanted it to be at least 8 out of 10, where are you right now?”
Another aspect of this competency is that the coach partners with the client
around what the client will do after the session in order for them to continue their
forward movement toward their ultimate goal. This inquiry is intended to support the
client to explore and decide upon additional thinking, behavioral changes, actions,
experiments, self-reﬂection, research or further assessment that the client will engage
in to continue with their progress beyond the coaching conversation. Note that there
are several ways for “next steps” to be realized and a tangible action is not always
necessarily what is most appropriate. Thinking may well be the perfect next step; in
98
13
Cultivating Learning and Growth Domain, Competency 8: Facilitates Client Growth

which case the coach can inquire about the focus and nature of the thinking and how
it will be in service of the client’s forward movement.
The development of next steps is intended to be a co-created process between
coach and client as the coach assists the client to decide upon steps that are going to
inspire them to maximize their potential and fulﬁll their goal. This may include the
coach offering encouragement to the client and being a champion of support and
belief in the client’s ability to take such steps. It may also include the coach offering
acknowledgement for the work the client has done so far in the coaching process and
even sharing with the client with an “if not now, when?” challenge in order to
support them to take the steps they have concluded will lead them toward their
desired outcome. The coach may potentially offer a suggestion to the client as long
as it is done without attachment, supports and honors the client’s autonomy, is in
service of the client’s agenda and forward movement and is aligned with the client’s
style.
Designing actions and goals for after the coaching is completed might include the
coach exploring the likelihood of an action occurring after the session as well as how
the client feels about taking that action and their willingness to commit. Considering
again the ICF deﬁnition of coaching: “Partnering with clients in a thought-provoking
and creative process that inspires them to maximize their personal and professional
potential.”
The key word this time is “inspires.” Whilst next steps may challenge the client,
the intention is that they can ﬁnd the resources necessary (from within themselves
and/or with the support of others) to take those steps because they are inspired to do
so in service of maximizing their potential as opposed to feeling they “should” do
something. Hence the partnering aspect is very important so that the client feels a
sense of self-ownership and that their plans post-coaching session are congruent and
accessible to them. This partnering will therefore also include identifying potential
obstacles and developing mitigating strategies as well as considering what types of
support the client might need to help them take the action. In some ways, this process
could be compared to the development of a project plan which can look great on
paper when designed within the conﬁnes of the project manager’s ofﬁce. However,
when taken out into the real world, the plan can fail almost before it has begun
because there was no risk analysis or implementation planning undertaken to ensure
the viability and success of the plan. This phase of the coaching process therefore
supports the client to leave the session with a robust plan that will lead them toward
success.
The coach also supports the client to reach a level of commitment to their goals
and plans (including mechanisms to apply and measure that commitment) for which
they can hold themselves accountable. Apart from establishing accountability, two
other aspects of this competency are that the coach partners with the client to bring
closure to the session (as opposed to being directive) and that the coach holds both
the bigger picture of the coaching work as well as what the client wants to achieve in
each session. In this way, the coach helps to hold the client accountable for their
overall progress toward their stated outcome, thereby underpinning the process of
supporting them to maximize their personal and professional potential.
What Next?

Conclusion
As you can hopefully appreciate, the exploration and work undertaken within this
competency is rich territory for the client to move forward, develop and grow in
ways that transcend the boundaries of the topic they brought into coaching and so it
is important that this aspect is given sufﬁcient time and space within the coaching
process and is not intended to be something the coach “shoe-horns” into the end of
the conversation when they notice the that session time is coming to a close. In
Chap. 7 we looked at Competency 3, Establishes and Maintains Agreements; we
explored how important it is to allow sufﬁcient time and space to fully explore the
client’s goals for the coaching process so that the work has a solid and clear
foundation. In the same way, this ﬁnal competency is a vital part of the coaching
process that underpins and enables the work done in the session to carry over into
new patterns and habits moving forward. We noted earlier that coaches often rush
through establishing the coaching agreement, and this is also often the case for this
ﬁnal competency. Part of a coach’s responsibility with their clients is to manage the
time boundaries set for the coaching sessions and, far too often, coaches run out of
time to work with this part of the coaching process adequately and ﬁnd themselves
squeezing in questions like: “We’ve got 2 minutes left, what are you going to do after
the session?” in a rather inelegant, clumsy and forced way.
The recommendation, therefore, is to remember the simple concept of beginning,
middle, and end so that the coaching session is balanced and paced, allowing for full
and rich exploration of all aspects of the client work.
Reviewing the 8 Core Competencies
Having considered each of the 8 core competencies and by way of bringing this
section to a close, I would like to offer a few ﬁnal thoughts to bring these compe-
tencies together. It has been noted before that coaching is sometimes described as a
dance and this embodies both the partnership between coach and client and also the
intertwined way in which the coach applies the core competencies. Whilst we have
covered each competency individually, it is important to remember that they are not
a checklist and they are not chronological in their occurrence. Some aspects of some
competencies lend themselves to be more present at the beginning or the end of a
coaching session, however the reality is that they all interrelate and form a contin-
uous and cohesive thread throughout the piece of work. Just a few examples of how
these competencies work together are that a thorough exploration of the client’s
goals for coaching (Comp 3) not only provides the foundation for the work, it also
allows for the perfect benchmark for the session to be brought to a relevant and
elegant close with appropriate next steps in place (Comp 8). Complete and active
listening (Comp 6) enables well placed and appropriate observations and interven-
tions from the coach (Comp 7). Clear thought-provoking questions (Comp 7) evoke
100
13
Cultivating Learning and Growth Domain, Competency 8: Facilitates Client Growth

the awareness that can be harnessed into important learning for the client (Comp 8).
Harnessing learning allows for the client to make choices and decisions that naturally
lead to actions and next steps (Comp 8). As the “dance” progresses, the quality of the
coach-client relationship (Comps 4 and 5) runs throughout the coaching process to
create the optimal conditions for impactful positive change for the client. When the
dance and ﬂow of these competencies have a strong professional and ethical
platform (Comp 1) and an embodied coaching mindset (Comp 2) the conditions
are set for the client to fully beneﬁt from the power of coaching!

Part III
Approaches to Coaching
Introduction
This part is a collection of nine chapters which explore a variety of different
psychological approaches that offer useful insight and application for the process
of coaching.
We begin with the universal eclectic approach which draws upon some of the
most popular models of psychology. In each case, we offer the background and an
overview of these approaches followed by speciﬁc examples of how they are
relevant and can be applied to coaching. In Chap. 14 we share the Universal Eclectic
Framework (UEF) and proceed to offer reﬂections on key features of this framework
including person-centered, behavioral, cognitive behavioral, Gestalt, systems, psy-
chodynamic, evolutionary, and biological.
Chapters 15–21 each look at a different psychological approach. Our intention
has been to offer an overview of the history and origins of these approaches and how
they developed. For each one, our key area of focus is to share how the principles
and philosophies of these approaches can be easily and clearly applied to coaching in
both a conceptual and very practical way. Each approach includes tools and models
that key ﬁgures in the ﬁeld have developed which bring the theories to life. We also
highlight how some of these principles are embedded within the language of the ICF
Core Competency Model.
Chapter 22 is the ﬁnal chapter of this part and positions the idea of integration.
The ability to ﬂex and adapt to the uniqueness of our clients and indeed the
uniqueness of each coaching conversation means that good coaching practice
draws upon multiple sources and resources. This results in an integrated approach
that is naturally, organically and intuitively present within the coaching relationship
and conversation. The seven streams integrated coaching model is shared as a way of
showing how these different approaches come together.

Chapter 14
The Universal Eclectic Coaching Approach
Introduction
In this chapter we will review the Universal Eclectic Coaching model. The model
draws on the eight most popular approaches from psychology and applies these to
coaching. We will look at each of the psychological models and how each can be
applied to coaching, with a focus on the most popular approaches used within
coaching;
person-centered,
behavioral,
cognitive
behavioral,
gestalt
and
psychodynamic.
Eclectic Coaching
Looking back over history, psychologists and philosophers have shared a common
interest in understanding how humans learn. A whole variety of theories have sprung
up, each with its own focus. Socrates, the Greek philosopher used questions as a way
to help his students to learn, although his provocative questions ultimately got him
into trouble. Other writers have suggested alternative approaches. B. F. Skinner
(1938) argued rewards can act as a stimulus for learning, while David Kolb (1984)
argued that our experiences in the real world are the key component for learning. He
suggested that by reﬂecting, theorizing and testing these out, adults can begin to
understand the world in new and different ways.
The Universal Eclectic Coaching model covers eight major psychology
approaches: Person-centered, behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, Gestalt, systems,
psychodynamic, evolutionary, and biological. The model was developed by Alison
Hardingham (2006) as the British Eclectic Model and subsequently developed
during her time at Henley Business School into the Universal Coaching Model.
Not all coaching approaches ﬁt neatly into the eight segments of the model, and
the model does not cover all psychological approaches. But the model does offer one

way of thinking about, and trying to categorize, the multiplicity of coaching
approaches that are now available for the coach.
The Universal Coaching Model starts by considering how each theory explains
how humans learn and develop. The learning is often described through a related
theory of learning or change. The development of such theories has often been
followed by a coaching approach that applies the theory to the environment of one-
to-one work. In many cases the ideas were originally applied to counseling, such as
psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. However, some approaches don’t
naturally ﬁt one-to-one work, such as evolutionary approaches, which view change
as taking place over millennia as opposed to months.
In other chapters in this book we explore some of these different approaches in
more depth. We focus on the approach and explore its roots, its application in
counseling and its adaptation into the world of coaching. In this this chapter we
aim to give a very brief overview of each of the different approaches where they have
been applied to coaching (Fig. 14.1).

The Universal Eclectic Coaching Approach

Person-Centered
The person-centered approach assumes that change is natural, provided the ‘funda-
mental conditions’ of warmth, genuineness and unconditional positive regard are
present. These fundamental conditions, sometimes called the ‘necessary and sufﬁ-
cient’ conditions are expressed through the coach-client relationship. Within this
relationship, development, growth or healing can take place. The essential tool for
the coach, or therapist, is thus the quality of the relationship, ensuring clients
experience the warmth and empathy offered by the coach. As a result, tools are a
less commonly used within person-centered approaches. In contrast the focus is on
the relationship, and how the coach uses listening, and displays empathy toward their
client.
Within coaching, one approach that embodies the person-centered philosophy is
Nancy Kline’s Time to Think (Kline, 1999), which we cover in Chap. 16.
Behavioral
Behavioral approaches emphasize the importance of rewards and punishments. The
belief is that animals, including human behavior, can be stimulated by rewards, such
as food, or a pay rise, and through this the animal begins to associate the reward with
the stimuli. This was illustrated by Ivan Pavlov (1927) who trained his dogs to
associate the reward of food with the ringing of a bell, and the work of B. F Skinner
who worked with pigeons and rats, training them to follow patterns of behavior
through the use of food rewards. The behavioralists believed it was not possible to
fully understand the “black box” of the mind, and thus it was better to focus on what
we could see: human behavior. If the individual’s behavior was “appropriate,” it did
not matter what people thought or believed, as all we can see was the behavior, not
their thoughts.
Behavior-based approaches underpin much of modern organizational manage-
ment. They form the theoretical basis for the use of competency frameworks and are
commonly used in development, such as appraisals ratings.
In coaching, the GROW model is a typical example of a behavior-based approach
(Whitmore, 1992). The GROW model as we discuss elsewhere is focused on human
behavior, although like other models it has drawn from other models over time
adding scaling and an exploration of faulty thinking. We cover more on GROW and
the behavioral approach in Chap.15.

What’s the reality of the situation you are facing right now?
What options do you have which will move you closer to this goal?

Cognitive Behavioral
The cognitive behavioral approach believes that learning, development and change
take place as a result of an interaction between behavior, cognition, emotion and an
external trigger. Commonly used models within this approach are ABCDEF and the
Current Bun model.
The coach will use the ABCDEF model to help the client work through the
challenging situation, challenging their unhelpful beliefs, and working to enable the
client to establish new more evidenced based, more logical and more enabling
beliefs. We explore the ABCDEF Model and the cognitive behavioral approach
more in Chap. 17.

B ¼ Beliefs (the views we hold about something)
C ¼ Consequences (our reactions; behavior, emotion, thoughts, physiological)
D ¼ Disputing statements (statements we tell ourselves that are helpful and
evidenced based
E ¼ Effective new beliefs (a new understanding/belief about the Activating
event)
F¼ Future action
Gestalt
Gestalt assumes that increases in awareness are key to change. By becoming more
aware of ourselves, of our environment and of our clients we can begin to observe
the patterns and the wider environment in which we are operating.
Gestalt regards the individual as a totality of mind, body, emotions and spirit,
with each person being unique. In therapy this means for Gestalt practitioners,
focusing on the present moment, and on immediate thought, feelings and sensations,
and brining these into the session to deepen understanding. The aim is to build
client’s self-conﬁdence and to help them live more in the present moment.
In coaching this translates into:
•
Paying attention to the body, as well as the mind
•
Being aware of the content and the environment
108
14
The Universal Eclectic Coaching Approach

•
Using metaphors and images
•
Using enactment such as Chairwork to explore ideas.
We explore the Gestalt approach further in Chap. 18.
Systems
Systems approaches are useful for helping the coach to recognize they are situated
within a speciﬁc role, team, organization, economic sector, national and historical
context. These systemic factors, or content, all inﬂuence how the individual client
and how others act.
Oshry (2007a, 2007b) brings this alive in his organizational system work noting
that most employees occur one of four conditions: Tops, Middles, Bottoms, and
Customers. Tops have designated responsibility (accountability) for some part of the
organisation, whether it is the whole organization, a division within it, a department,
a project team, or a classroom. They have all the responsibility, but feel that no one
does as they ask. Bottoms carry out tasks, they think higher ups ought to be taking
care of and provide them with information, but fail to do so. Middles experience
conﬂicting demands. Bottoms demand resources and information, while Tops
demand action. Middle feels they can never satisfy both groups. Finally, customers
are looking to some other person to provide a product or service in order to move
ahead, but feel continually let down by the “system.”
Even in the most complex, multilevel, multifunctional organizations, each of us is
constantly moving in and out of Top/Middle/Bottom/Customer conditions. In each
of these conditions there are unique opportunities for contributing to total system
power; and in each there are pitfalls that readily lead us to forfeit those contributions.
To bring this alive in our coaching work the coach invites the client to:
•
Reﬂect on the importance of the organizational context
•
Draws on family metaphors to help clients to recognize the inter relationship
between elements
•
Helps clients to become more politically astute
Techniques such as Force Field and Constellations can help clients to consider the
systemic forces at work and develop plans to manage these. For example Force Field
involves asking clients to identify, list and assess the strength of both forces for
change (the desired outcome) and those resisting change (the desired outcomes,
while Consellations explores the stakeholders and their relationships).
We explore the systemic approach and the Force Field Model in more depth in
Chap. 20.
Systems
109

Psychodynamic
Psychodynamic psychology is concerned with the dynamic unconscious. The belief
is that as human, much like an iceberg, most of our feelings and behavior are driven
by instincts and thoughts that are outside of our awareness (the unconscious).
This can manifest itself in many ways, as defenses, such as projection, denial,
projective identiﬁcation and acting. The role of the psychodynamic coach is to help
clients to be more aware of these mechanisms, to understand their origins, triggers
and the identify ways to manage these defenses if they are considered unhelpful.
The psychodynamic approach is explored in more depth in Chap. 21.
Evolutionary
The evolutional psychology is concerned with explaining why humans have evolved
in the way we have. Given Darwin’s theory of the origin of the species (1859), why
have certain traits or aspects of human thought, feelings and behavior survived?
What beneﬁts do they confer?
In coaching terms these psychological theories have informed neuroscience
coaching. By helping clients to understand the brain, its structure, function and
operation, clients can be more aware of how the brain as a device can both help and
hinder their pursuit of their goals.
Biological
Biological explanations of human behavior are informed by genetics and how our
genes determine human behavior. There remains considerable debate about the
balance between nature (genes) and nurture (environment and relationships). The
general consensus suggests that about 60% of human behavior is determined by our
genes, with 40% responding to environmental factors. Even with 40% this leaves
huge capacity for clients to make a choice about their behavior.
In coaching terms these psychological theories inform approaches such as
Somatic coaching. Somatics is concerned with the whole body, helping clients to
be more bodily aware, and through observation of bodily sensations to be more
sensitive to their own changing emotions and thoughts.
Box 14.3 Applying the Universal Coaching Model

(continued)

Box 14.3 (continued)
Sandra had requested a challenging conversation about career aspirations,
Ross felt that he was quite needed during the conversation. She was anxious
about coaching and about her role in the company. Ross looked to draw on the
‘necessary and sufﬁcient conditions’ to help provide a relational platform on
which the future work could build.
Ross spent the ﬁrst hour of the session listening to Sandra’s story. Ross was
warm, and high afﬁrming, reﬂecting back both what he heard in terms of
words and feelings.
Once the relationship was secure, Ross moved onto some cognitive behav-
ioral work. Sandra was inclined to see her lack of leadership promotions as a
sign she was less capable than other managers. Ross encouraged Sandra to
explore these limiting beliefs and using chaining to identify and ultimately to
challenge a core identify that Sandra viewed herself as ‘unworthy’ to be a
leader in her organization.
As the work continued Ross decided Sandra would beneﬁt by thinking
about the system in which she worked. The organization leadership was male
dominated and there were a limited number of female role models. Sandra felt
this was demotivating and was having a negative impact on her relationship
with the organization. Ross used the force ﬁeld analysis technique to explore
how the organization currently limited her scope for leading (Systemic). This
was followed by some Chair (Gestalt) to help her to plan for a difﬁcult
conversation with her boss and HR who has made public commitments to
increase the number of women in leadership roles in the organization. The use
of that technique was in itself challenging for Sandra, as he had never tried
anything like that before. It increased his urgency for change and provided her
with a script to take away and explain her perspective in a way which her boss
and HR could hear, and to offer some positive suggestions for change.
During the ﬁnal phases of the coaching assignment Ross drew on behav-
ioral technique, inviting Sandra to observe other senior female leaders and
‘model’, their approach to leading, as well as to think about what role she was
modeling for other female employees who may be looking to Sandra as their
role model, as their champion for change.
Lessons About How to Use the Model
The ﬁrst thing which is worth noting is that like most models we use in coaching, the
model is invisible to clients. The aim of the model is to provide a heuristic or map for
the coach to guide their approach to working with clients.
What the client will see is the behaviors that the coach employs, and the tools the
coach selects. The coach needs to know the tools sufﬁciently well to enable them to
select the most appropriate tool to the client, as opposed to continually selecting their
Lessons About How to Use the Model
111

favorite three or four tools with every client. The best coaching is co-created in the
moment; it is led by the needs of the client and delivered in partnership with them
through a collaborative process.
If you do want to introduce a tool, and you are unsure, or you judge the tool may
be well outside of the comfort zone of your client, one way to do this is to describe
the use of the tool as an ‘experiment’. In this you can model the idea that it is possible
to try out new ideas and monitor their impact before deciding whether to continue or
repeat their use more widely. This has the beneﬁt of reducing the pressure on the
coach of ‘being perfect’, and simply testing and evaluating the technique, using a
cycle of practice, observe, reﬂect, and adapt for the next iteration of the cycle.
Finally, before adding the technique to your repertoire, it’s worth testing it ﬁve or
six times with different clients and in different situations. Use a reﬂective journal to
make notes of how and when you used it and what your client feedback to you about
how the tool landed. Mastery remerges only through repeated application and
reﬂection.
Conclusion
In this chapter we have aimed to describe the Universal Coaching Model and
provided brief insights into eight different psychological perspectives on learning
and change, and how these perspectives have been applied by different writers and
thinkers to coaching. The Universal Coaching Model is one way to think about using
different evidenced based approaches in your coaching practice. It combines eight
speciﬁc psychological approaches. As you will see from the Integrated Model in
Chap. 22, it is not the only way. Ultimately, we believe each coach needs to ﬁnd their
own way to draw together a range of different frameworks, and be able to integrate
these for their clients, changing and adapting to meet their clients’ needs.

Chapter 15
Behavioral Approach and the GROW
Model
Introduction
The GROW model is possibly the most popular coaching framework in use across
the world. Its popularity is due to the combination of its simplicity as a ‘four box
model’ combined with its power to summarize a step-by-step route to problem
solving, making use of psychological theory along the way.
The tool was originally developed by Sir John Whitmore, Graham Alexander,
and Alan Fine, during their time working as organizational consultants in the UK. Its
origins are in behavioral psychology, with a strong goal focus and desire to set,
achieve and measure outcomes. GROW can be integrated with other coaching
techniques and is also used beyond coaching as a problem-solving process.
Behavioral Psychology
The GROW model can be considered to ﬁt within the behavioral psychology
tradition, given its focus on what people do, as opposed to what people think. Few
models developed through practice, are a perfect ﬁt to theory. GROW is no excep-
tion. However, over the years, the model has drawn techniques from other models,
such as scaling from solution focused and perceptual positions from Gestalt.
The model however ﬁts within the behavioral psychological school and the work
of researchers such as Skinner, Pavlov, and Watson during the 1930s. Their interest
was in understanding how others learned through an objective, quantiﬁed approach
to explaining and predicting behavior. These ideas were being developed in parallel
with modern management that looked to psychologists for ideas on how to improve
efﬁciency and the movement from craft production to modern manufacturing tech-
niques. The outcome was Taylor’s scientiﬁc management (Taylor, 1911), which

113

subsequently has provided the core platform for human resources practice over the
past century.
The GROW Model
The model comprises four phases, which are deployed ﬂexibly by the coach (Alex-
ander, 2016; Whitmore, 2017). The coach may start with the Goal, moving to
reality, but can return to the Goal to further clarify and reﬁne the goal, before
progressing to the Options stage.
Phase 1: Establishing the Goal
The ﬁrst phase involves the coach working with their client to establish a goal. This
may start with a general exploration of the wider purpose for the conversation, taking
into account the brief from the sponsor, and contextual factors. It may move into an
exploration of the speciﬁc goal and the focus for the individual session. In some
models the preliminary discussion of the topic has seen the model re-labeled as
T-GROW.
During this phase of the model the coach’s aim is to help their client to set a
clearly deﬁned, measurable and meaningful goal for the session. The more clearly
deﬁned the goal is, the more meaningful it is for the client, the more likely progress
can be made.
As a result, it is helpful to encourage clients to deﬁne clear measures of success,
milestones, but also to think about how important the goal is and how it connects to
other objectives and their values.
Sometimes the goal that emerges needs to be amended or clariﬁed. The model is
intended to be ﬂexible and adaptable to the requirements of each client, so it is
possible for the coach to step back into the Goal stage if more work is needed to
clarify or reﬁne the goal.
Box 15.1 Goal: Some Helpful Questions
•
‘We have an hour together, what do you want to leave the room having
achieved in that time?’
•
‘What are you hoping to achieve through this goal?’
•
Why is this goal important for you now?
•
‘How will you know when you have achieved the goal?’
•
‘When are you aiming to achieve this by?’
114
15
Behavioral Approach and the GROW Model

Phase 2: Exploring the Current Reality
In the second phase the coach encourages the client to explore the current situation as
it relates to their chosen topic. Sometimes clients may want to move to action
quickly, and skip over an exploration of the issue, what they have tried before and
why this has not worked. During this phase of the model the coach’s aim is to help
their client to stand back and, through open questions, take time to reﬂect on all the
ramiﬁcations of the situation. In addition to broadening and deepening their client’s
understanding, the reﬂective time will provide a foundation for the next phase;
generating and evaluating options.
During the reality discussion it will be helpful for the client to explore what they
have tried so far, blockages to achieving the desired outcome, reviewing the situation
from a number of different stakeholder perspectives, identifying likely causes and
effects, and thinking about impacts on the client’s performance and that of their
colleagues. As these aspects are discussed possible solutions may begin to emerge
from these considerations. However, it is important for the coach to help their client
to “park” these and remain focused on their exploration of the reality.
At this stage it can be easy for the coach to start following their own line of
inquiry, gathering evidence to prove their hypothesis. It’s important for the coach to
remember that the coaching conversation is in the service of the client. This means
questions should not be focused toward evidence collection but towards deepening
the client’s self-awareness and insight.
Box 15.2 Reality: Some Helpful Questions
•
What have you done so far to move toward your goal?
•
What have you learned from these efforts?’
•
‘What is happening now?
•
‘What is working well right now?’
•
‘What constraints have stopped you moving toward your goal?
Phases 3a and 3b: Generating and Evaluating Options
The Options stage is best seen as having two sub-parts. We have labeled these as 3a
option generation and 3b option evaluation. It’s important not to get these tangled, as
moving to an evaluation of the ﬁrst two or three pros and cons, may limit the
generation of subsequent and often more creative and unusual solutions.
As with the reality phase it is helpful to create the space for clients to explore,
brainstorm or use idea writing to enable them to generate as many ideas as possible,
before starting to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each.
If a very detailed picture has been created during the reality phase, the client will
have a good foundation for generating ideas. It can be helpful to encourage them to
The GROW Model
115

think of ‘off-the-wall’ ideas as well as those that may seem more obviously feasible.
Using techniques such as VIP and Post-Its (discussed in Chap. 34) can be a helpful in
generating more ideas. Sometimes there is the kernel of something very useful in
what may ﬁrst seem a crazy possibility.
They may come up with ideas that are completely novel, or the options they
generate may be adaptations of, or can help to conﬁrm existing thinking. What is
important here is that the coach supports the client through open questions to expand
the options. We ﬁnd that clients can ﬁnd this more difﬁcult to do themselves and the
role of the coach here can be particularly helpful in expanding their thinking.
Once there is a feeling that multiple options have been generated, the second part
of this phase is to evaluate the options. Depending on the client’s preference this can
be undertaken formally, using a pre-determined set of criteria which the client
generates, or more informally, talking about each option’s beneﬁts and risks.
Box 15.3 Options: Some Helpful Questions
•
“What could you do to move toward your goal? What else could you do?
And what else?”
•
“If you were the chief executive of Google, what would you do?”
•
“Have you encountered something like this before? What worked then that
might work now?”
•
“Think of someone who does this kind of thing really well—What do they
do that you could try?”
•
“You have 5 min, write down as many ideas for solving this as possible.”
Phase 4: Wrap-Up/Will/Way Forward
By this point in the conversation the client will have generated a score of ideas, a
number of which are feasible solutions in their own mind. The W phase involves
helping the client to select the speciﬁc option, or options they are motivated to take
forward. The development of the “action plan” needs to be something they feel
conﬁdent about and capable of progressing with. The plan also needs to acknowl-
edge how to move forward, including resources, support, and potential barriers (see
Chap. 13 for a full discussion of Facilitates Client Growth). It is also helpful to focus
on the support that the person can draw on as they progress with their plan. This
support team may offer motivation, resources, or be able to hold the individual to
account. Then the client can be invited to identify the actionable ﬁrst steps they wish
to take.
The W has also been used for will. We have found it helpful to also invite the
client to consider their motivation to act. You might ask them to scale this for
example, “On a scale of 1–10, how motivated are you to start progressing with this
plan immediately?” What we ﬁnd is clients who score less than 6, or who use phrases
like “I am deﬁnitely thinking about this,” or “I would really like to do this,” have yet
116
15
Behavioral Approach and the GROW Model

to commit. We suggest further work is required with these clients to ensure they are
committed to any actions in their plan.
It is worth recognizing that in some conversations the outcome or goal will not be
a series of speciﬁc actions but learning or insights. These are equally valuable.
At this stage it’s also worth acknowledging the work the client has done so far in
building their plan through an afﬁrmation statement—“Well, that’s some great work
you have done in thinking through this challenge and coming up with a plan which
you are taking away.”
The ﬁnal step is to invite the client to reﬂect back on their work within the session
as a mechanism to develop further insight about themselves and meta-learning. The
use of two or three questions at this stage add value for the client from the session
and enable them to better understand how the GROW framework may be something
they can take away and use as a tool to think through other issues.
In Box 15.4 we have summarize some of the questions which the coach might use
at this stage of the model and which are consistent with the approach in
Competency 8.
Box 15.4 Wrap-Up: Some Helpful questions
•
Which of all the options you have come up will you take forward?
•
What support do you need from your organization?
•
How will you go about getting this support?
•
What’s the very ﬁrst step you’re going to take?
•
On a scale of 1–10 (where 10 is high), how committed are you to your plan
of action?
•
What insights has this conversation provided for you?
•
What have you learnt, that you can apply to similar leadership challenges?

goal, a review of the current reality, before considering the alternative options and

Conclusion
The GROW model has become one of the most popular coaching models in the
world because of its simplistic. It’s easy to remember and when followed, creates a
useful structure for a problem-solving conversation, either as a coach or as a self-
coaching tool. In this chapter we have explored the GROW model of behavioral
change. We described the stages of the model and discussed potential traps for the
coach at each stage. We have also provided a series of questions at each stage as a
handrail for the new coach.

Behavioral Approach and the GROW Model

Chapter 16
Humanistic Approach and the Time
to Think Model
Introduction
The humanistic approach (sometimes called person-centered approach) is in some
ways at the very heart of coaching. This approach embraces the belief that within all
of us is a ‘self-righting reﬂex’. This links well to coaching, where we hold the
perspective that our clients are creative, resourceful, and whole. It also relates well to
the idea that if we can discover this aspect of ourselves, we can achieve any goal. The
Time to Think model (More Time to Think, Kline, 2009) applies these principles to
coaching conversations, with a focus on the relationship, suggesting that the role of
the coach is more often to get out of the way than to intervene with multiple
questions, insights, or reﬂections.
In this chapter we explore the humanistic approach, its implications for the
coaching relationship, and how we can bring this alive in our coaching work through
the Time to Think approach.
The Humanistic Approach
The humanistic approach is sometimes called the “third force” as it challenged two
previous psychological schools of thought: behaviorist and psychodynamic. Some
psychologists felt those two were somewhat limiting whereas the humanistic
approach focuses on the whole person and the uniqueness of each individual. This
way of working is also directed toward development, growth and progress as
opposed to the perceived pessimism or pathology associated with approaches such
as psychoanalysis. The emphasis therefore with humanistic psychology is on choice
and agency and the person’s ability to make healthy conscious choices given the
right circumstances.

Humanistic psychology ﬁrst developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s and
became very popular during the 1970s and 1980s. It is underpinned by some basic
assumptions:
•
People have free will
•
People are basically good
•
People are motivated to self-actualize
•
The individual’s subjective experience is most important
•
Challenges scientiﬁc methodology
•
Rejects comparative psychology (study of animals)
Carol Rogers was central to the therapeutic aspect of this approach and two other
key contributors to this ﬁeld were Abraham Maslow and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi.
Rogers initially developed the approach and, building upon the assumptions,
focused on the principle that people are their own best experts and are, as such,
the best source of reference for their wellbeing and development. A core theme to
humanistic psychology is what is known as our “actualizing tendency”: a motiva-
tional drive leading to growth, development and autonomy that can also be described
as the “self-righting reﬂex” noted in the introduction. This concept of self-
actualization was ﬁrst coined by Rogers and further developed by Maslow (1968)
when it was positioned at the top of a human being’s hierarchy of needs.
Csikszentmihalyi (2002) also engaged with this concept in his work on how the
combination of certain conditions allows us to achieve and experience a state of
“ﬂow” leading to sensations of deep concentration, enjoyment, fulﬁllment and
happiness. In essence, the principle of self-actualization is that it is a natural
human process that, given the right conditions, the individual will be motivated to
and be able to grow and reach their full potential. Part of the role of the practitioner
therefore is to enable the client to feel a stronger and healthier sense of self so that
they may access and realize their self-actualization tendency.
Sometimes the humanistic approach can be linked with an existential approach
and the inquiry may explore the client’s sense of self with regards to their purpose
and the meaning of life.
Relationship Is Central
The humanistic approach is relationship based. It can be argued that all forms of
coaching (as well as other modalities such as therapy, consultancy and mentoring)
are relationship based, however the humanistic approach is considered to be highly
non-directive. In this way, the principles and assumptions that underpin this
approach are honored. The humanistic way would propose that it is the
non-directive nature of the relationship that enables the process of self-actualization.
Characteristic of, and in keeping with, this non-directive relationship, Rogers
believed that change is a natural human process and that there are six necessary
and sufﬁcient conditions for positive change.

Humanistic Approach and the Time to Think Model

Box 16.1 Necessary and Sufﬁcient Conditions for Change
1. Coach-client psychological contact (the relationship must exist and be one
that feels safe to the client)
2. The client is in-congruent (in-congruence exists between the client’s expe-
rience and their awareness of that experience)
3. Coach congruence, or genuineness (the coach is authentic, deeply present
with their client, not acting and is able to draw upon their own intuition and
experience to facilitate the relationship and the client’s progress)
4. Coach holds unconditional positive regard for their client (the coach acts
without judgment, disapproval or approval and champions an increase of
self-regard in their client)
5. Coach has empathic understanding (the coach demonstrates empathic
understanding of the client’s inner world and their concerns, thus increasing
and evidencing their unconditional positive regard)
6. Client perception (the client perceives and experiences the coach’s uncon-
ditional positive regard and empathy)
Time to Think Model
A key contributor to the application of the humanistic approach in coaching is Nancy
Kline and her work titled Time to Think (1999). The sub-title to Kline’s book is:
Listening to Ignite the Human Mind, and this epitomizes the idea that the coach’s
contribution is largely centered on the belief that their client is indeed creative,
resourceful, and whole, and therefore has a self-righting reﬂex. As such, the role of
coach is to honor that belief by building a safe and empathic relationship and to then
get out of the client’s way, creating space and time for them to think so that they may
access and utilize their own inner resources.
With this approach, the coach listens to the client without judgment, allowing
the client to come to insights themselves. The role of the coach is to ensure that all of
the client’s thoughts and feelings about their topic are being considered and that the
coach fully understands the concerns of the client, in a non-directive way and which
brings a degree of warmth, acceptance and empathy. The coach employs strong
skills of active listening, going with the client, at their pace for the client to uncover
their insights and make choices that will lead them to fulﬁll their potential.
Origins of the Time to Think Model
Inspired by her own mother’s capacity for listening and deep presence along with her
own studies in the ﬁelds of education, counseling and philosophy, Kline observed
that everything we do depends for its quality on the thinking we do ﬁrst. Thinking

comes ﬁrst; therefore, to improve action we have to ﬁrst improve thinking. She had
co-founded a school to help teenagers think for themselves and consistently
observed the difference when students thought clearly and for themselves and
when they did not. What was less obvious was what enabled them to do so. Age,
gender, background, intelligence and experience seemed to make little difference.
However, one differentiator began to emerge and that was how they were being
treated by the people with them when they were thinking. Kline and her colleagues
discovered that when someone is trying to think, much of what the “listener” hears
and sees is the effect that they themselves is having on the “thinker.” They decided
that if it were possible to identify what was thinking-enhancing behavior, it could be
learnt and therefore taught to others. Over the following years, Kline and her
colleagues identiﬁed and described the components of this Thinking Environment.
As the concept of the Thinking Environment evolved, Kline remembered and
compared some of the qualities she experienced with her mother, whose listening
had such a profound and positive impact for her. These included:
•
Naturally keeping her eyes on the other person
•
Being at ease in her own posture, settling in to listen carefully
•
Her tone and sounds she made while listening
•
Laughing with, never at
•
Conveying equality and encouragement
•
Comfortable and relaxed with the other person’s emotion and feelings of fear
•
Occasionally and un-intrusively giving information needed
•
Afﬁrming, not criticizing
•
Not interrupting
•
Showing joy when the person discovered an insight
At the heart of these behaviors was attention. Later, a client of Kline’s summed
this up as: the quality of a person’s attention determines the quality of other people’s
thinking. Kline and her colleagues proposed the following two statements:
1. Everything we do depends upon the thinking we do ﬁrst.
2. Our thinking depends upon the quality of our attention for each other.
In this case, the most important thing we can do is to listen to people so well and
so carefully, to give them attention so respectfully so that they may think for
themselves, clearly and in a new way.
Whilst attentive listening is crucial, Kline also noticed that there are times when
this is not quite enough. Some blocks to thinking need more than just deep attention
alone to enable the person to move beyond them. It seemed clear that the answer had
something to do with questions, however it was not known what type of questions or
in fact what the blocks to thinking generally were about. After two more years of
study, it became clearer that the blocks were almost always associated with assump-
tions being made by the thinker. These assumptions were largely unconscious and
yet were being framed or experienced by the thinker as “truths.” Of all the possible
blocks to thinking, it was found that assumptions were the most powerful and
troublesome.
122
16
Humanistic Approach and the Time to Think Model

Kline’s ongoing work uncovered three types of assumptions with several subsets
and concluded that being able to recognize them would help to remove them. Over
time, certain questions were found to work in the removal of the assumptions. These
were developed into a process called incisive questions which, when combined with
the best possible attentive listening, can enable the human mind to move past the
barriers of assumptions toward new, different and previously inconceivable ways of
thinking.
The Thinking Environment
Eventually, the essential behaviors that comprised the thinking environment became
clear and ten ways of being together and treating each other were identiﬁed.
Box 16.2 The Ten Components of a Thinking Environment
1. Attention: Listening with respect, interest, fascination and without
interruption
2. Incisive questions: Removing the assumptions that limit thinking and
ideas, freeing the mind to create new and different thinking.
3. Equality: Treating each other as thinking peers. Giving equal turns and
attention, keeping arrangements and boundaries.
4. Appreciation: Practicing a ﬁve-to-one ratio of appreciation to criticism,
encouraging and enabling the person to feel safe to wander and delve into
deep free thinking.
5. Ease: Offering freedom from rush or urgency so that the thinking process
has space and time to emerge and evolve.
6. Encouragement: Moving beyond competition. Internal competition and
judgment make new, high-quality thoughts impossible. With no inner
competition, there is no inner conﬂict, thereby allowing free thinking to
happen.
7. Feelings: Allowing sufﬁcient emotional release to restore thinking. Feel-
ings cloud judgment and so the full expression of those feelings creates
space for thinking to be restored and for free thinking to happen.
8. Information: Providing a full and accurate picture of reality. Information
can help to build up thinking and when faced with the clarity of full facts,
the mind can wander and explore strategies and solutions.
9. Place: Creating a physical environment that says back to people, “you
matter.”
10. Diversity: Adding quality because of the differences between us.
The Thinking Environment
123

Incisive Questions
The three kinds of assumptions Kline identiﬁed are:
1. Facts
2. Possible facts
3. Bedrock assumptions about the self and about how life works
Incisive questions are designed to remove these assumptions by a combination of
memory and simplicity. It is important to remember how the thinker has described
their assumption, in the exact words they used. When applicable, it is also important
to remember what words or phrase they have used for the positive opposite of this
assumption, again in their exact words.
Regarding simplicity, one of the simplest and cleanest incisive questions starts
with: “If you knew. . . .” What makes a question incisive is that it cuts cleanly into the
assumption and removes it. It replaces the assumption with a new, freeing assump-
tion, a new truth that is based on positive choice.
The incisive question typically has three parts:
1. Hypothesis: “If you knew. . .”
2. Followed by a freeing true assumption: “. . .that you are perfectly skilled for this
task. . .”
3. Attach the new assumption to the goal: “. . . how would you respond to your
boss’s request?”
If you knew þ freeing assumption þ goal = incisive question
By asking the incisive question once, you may hear one idea. By asking it again,
you will hear another. Repetition of the question, in exactly the same wording and
format, is recommended and can give rise to many free and ﬂowing ideas that had
been previously blocked by the limiting assumption.
The tense used is also an important characteristic of the incisive question. For
example: “If you knew, that you are perfectly capable. . . .” By using the present
tense, we are stating the positive new assumption as a truth. The hypothetical parts of
the question are the ﬁrst three words (“If you knew. . .”) and in the last part when
asking for their ideas about their goal (“. . .how would you respond to your boss’s
request?”). Here the verbs are hypothetical because we are just supposing. We are
not demanding that the thinker believe it, we are inviting them into playful specu-
lation. This playful speculation provides mitigation against the thinker feeling
defensive or resistant, allowing them to think freely and imaginatively without fear
of judgment or commitment to act. It is this playful sense of possibility, versus
requirement, which opens up the space for ideas to emerge and action to follow.
The best incisive questions are those which emerge carefully an organically from
the dance of the coaching conversation, however some useful examples have been
collected which also show how the three parts are a consistent feature.

(Maintain total attention to how the person’s thinking is developing).
‘What more do you think” “What more do you think, feel or want to say?”

that the person has got to the end of their thinking so far. This may be eye
contact and a statement such as “I think that’s it”)
“What more do you want achieve from this session?”
Repeat the goal using the person’s own words. If necessary the coach might
ask the client “please can you say that in fewer words”.
A question that enables further thinking:

“If you knew that (enter their words for what is true and liberating), how
would you (enter their words for what they want to achieve)?”
Listen to the answer.
Ask the question again if required, until it has generated all the thinking it is

Conclusion
In this chapter we have looked at what is the humanistic or person-centered
approach. We have described the roots of humanistic psychology and how it is
based upon certain assumptions that embrace the wholeness of the person and a
human being’s actualizing-tendency toward growth and potential, given the right
conditions and environment. We have noted how this approach challenged other
psychological schools of thought and highlighted who have been the main devel-
opers and contributors to this ﬁeld. Whilst this approach has its origins in the
therapeutic setting, there are many aspects of this approach which have direct
relevance and are applicable to the context of coaching. An understanding of
human needs, how we achieve a state of “ﬂow” and Rogers’s necessary and
sufﬁcient conditions for change are all very useful concepts in the coaching space.
We have then seen how Kline’s Time to Think model offers great insight into
how and why the skills of deep listening, presence and incisive questions build upon
the work of Rogers and the create conditions for change to occur by enabling the
client remove limiting assumptions, thereby releasing and freeing new and creative
thought. Finally, we have seen how this humanistic approach can also be found and
is reﬂected in some of the competencies within the ICF Core Competency Model.

Chapter 17
Cognitive Behavioral Approach
and ABCDEF Model
Introduction
Cognitive behavioral coaching (CBC) emerged from cognitive behavioral therapy
and the work of therapists like Arnold Lazarus, Aaron Beck, and Albert Ellis in the
1960s and 1970s and has been developed by writers such as Windy Dryden in the
2000s. The approach aims to help clients recognize the connection between their
thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. It has been developed by coaches such as Stephen
Palmer and Michael Neenan to work with non-clinical issues, the aim being to move
away from unhelpful thoughts toward more evidence-based, performance enhancing
thinking, and in so doing improve performance or wellbeing. In this chapter we will
we will explore cognitive behavioral coaching as a tool that can help clients enhance
their personal resilience, better manage stress, support them during organizational
change, and address faulty thinking.
Cognitive Behavioral Model
Cognitive behavioral therapy argues that for change to take place in a client’s
behavior, the client needed to understand the forces which were acting on them
and triggering their behavior. These forces may be driven by the individual’s
emotion: “I threw the cup across the room because I was angry,” or due to thoughts:
“I threw the cup across the room, because I thought the neighbor’s cat was about to
pee on my kitchen ﬂoor.”
The development of cognitive behavioral coaching builds on the early work of
Albert Ellis (1962), Aaron Beck (1976), and Arnold Lazarus (1981), who developed
cognitive behavioral therapy, rational emotive behavioral therapy, and multi-modal
therapy for work with their clients, as well as more recent writers such as Windy
Dryden, who has written extensively on CBT.

Ellis looked into the relationship between conscious thought, emotions, behavior,
and happiness. He developed Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) on the
premise that one’s beliefs inﬂuence the emotional and behavioral outcomes linked to
a particular event. For instance, if an individual believes that they are a bad presenter,
and public speaking is part of their job, they might feel anxious when they need to
undertake this task. This anxiety, linked to the belief they are a bad presenter, is
likely to negatively impact their performance during a presentation. Ellis suggested
that challenging and reframing such beliefs and replacing such thoughts with more
logical- or evidence based-thinking would be helpful for clients.
Beck argued that automatic thoughts (i.e. repetitive and systematically incorrect
thought patterns) are responsible for negative emotions such as depression and
anxiety. This internal critical dialogue could impact negatively on an individual’s
self-esteem, self-efﬁcacy, and overall self-worth. His cognitive behavioral approach
suggests that this internal dialogue can be changed by bringing it into awareness,
challenging its credibility, and reframing it more positively and constructively.
Cognitive distortions (or thinking errors) are another contribution of Beck’s cogni-
tive therapy and refer to people’s use of distorted or incomplete data to make
conclusions that are inaccurate (Beck, 1976).
Some examples of thinking errors are:
•
All-or-nothing thinking—also known as black-and-white thinking
•
Catastrophizing—anticipation of the worst possible outcome only
•
Disqualifying or discounting the positive—seeing this as accidental or lucky
•
Labeling oneself—thus accepting a limit to the possible outcome
•
Mind reading—assuming one knows what others are thinking or are intending to
do without any evidence supporting this view.
Following its development in therapy, cognitive behavioral coaching (CBC)
emerged in the 2000s (Williams et al., 2014; Palmer and Williams, 2013). This
approach has followed a similar approach: helping clients see links between
thoughts, feelings, and behavior; helping clients recognize automatic and incorrect
thinking patterns; and challenging these by developing more logical and evidence-
based thoughts.
More recently, the “third wave” of CBT has also inﬂuenced the development of
new CBC practices and models, including acceptance and commitment coaching
(Anstiss and Blonna, 2014), mindfulness-based coaching (Hall, 2014), and
compassion-based coaching (Anstiss and Gilbert, 2014). The effectiveness of cog-
nitive behavioral approaches has been extensively validated through research in
counseling and more in a growing number of coaching studies (Bozer and
Jones, 2018).
Cognitive behavioral coaching is goal-directed, focused on the present, and takes
place within a limited and deﬁned period of time (Neenan and Palmer, 2001). It
holds the same premises as CBT with its focus on emotional, psychological and
behavioral blocks to performance. By understanding how their beliefs can lead to
negative perceptions, the coach works with the client to develop greater awareness of
thoughts and emotions and their impact on behaviors. Using a cognitive behavioral
128

approach the coach aims to help their clients (a) make better progress toward realistic
goals; (b) enhance self-awareness of the relationship between thoughts, feelings and
behaviors; (c) develop more effective thinking; (d) strengthen their internal resources
and resilience to support their action plan; and (e) develop their ability to self-coach
(Palmer and Williams, 2013; Palmer and Szymanska, 2019).
Cognitive Behavioral ABCDEF Model
There are various CBC models including SPACE (Social Context, Physiology,
Action, Cognition, Emotion), (Williams and Palmer, 2013) and PRACTICE (Prob-
lem Identiﬁcation, Realistic Goals, Alternative Solutions, Consideration of Conse-
quences, Target most Feasible Solutions, Implementation of Chosen Solutions,
Evaluation) (Palmer, 2007). We will focus on the most popular CBC tool, the
ABCDEF Model (Palmer, 2002). The model uses six steps that the client moves
through to gain insight into the relationship between their thoughts, feelings, and
behavior, and to develop a new, more effective, outlook (see Fig. 17.1).
The six steps are: an activating event (or awareness of the issue); beliefs and
perceptions (rational or irrational) about the activating event; consequences (emo-
tional, behavioral and physiological); disputing or examining beliefs; effective new
beliefs (response or emotional state); and future focus.

This is the trigger (event) which starts the chain

the event or what can happen as a result of the

Cognitive Behavioral ABCDEF Model
129

There are a number of different approaches to using the tool. One popular one is
to invite the client to initially describe the event (A) and move to exploring the
consequences (C). Most clients ﬁnd it easier to explore what happens to them in
terms of the sensations they experience and the emotions, after describing the events
and how they behaved in the moment. Clients are generally less capable at describ-
ing their thought processes without help. It is thus best to come to explore beliefs,
after encouraging clients to talk about consequences (Client: “I could feel the hairs
on my arm standing up,” or “My heart was racing”). The sensations may be followed
by an exploration of the client’s emotions (Client: “I knew I was really scared about
what would happen next”). Having established the emotion, it is then possible to
explore thoughts (Coach: “What were you thinking was going to happen?”). Clients
may talk about initial thoughts, but it can often be helpful to get clients to think more
critically, and in more detail. Many clients hold a series of beliefs; by chaining down
through these layers of beliefs, we can help clients establish their core belief. These
commonly are about self-worth, self-esteem, or how the client feels they will be
judged by others. But it is important not to make assumptions about the client and
their thought patterns. Each client is different, and we need to remain open and
curious, as we discussed in Chap. 4.
Once the thoughts associated with the trigger and the underlying beliefs have
been identiﬁed the coach can help the client to begin to challenge these unhelpful
beliefs. In most cases the belief is irrational, illogical, as well as being unhelpful. It
can thus be helpful at the disputation stage to encourage clients to recognize this. We
can do that by asking clients how helpful, logical the belief is, and what the evidence
is for the belief.
It is common in cognitive behavioral therapy for the therapist to invite clients to
complete a chart to help them identify how frequently these unhelpful beliefs are
undermining their efforts. In Table 17.1 we have provided an illustration how clients
might complete this between sessions.

Cognitive Behavioral Approach and ABCDEF Model

Once the unhelpful beliefs have been disputed through evidence-based perspec-
tives, new beliefs can be identiﬁed by the client. With a series of helpful new beliefs,
the client can then test these out in the real world and move on to implement their
new plan.
What we have found in our own practice is that old beliefs are not like a light;
easy to switch off. Old beliefs can be intrusive and pervasive, haunting the client
despite the new strategy and the knowledge that the old thinking is unhelpful and
irrational. To overcome this, we encourage clients to see a movement toward the new
beliefs as a process which can take weeks, months, or years. If the client beats
themselves up when the old beliefs hang around, this only serves to reinforce
unhelpful core beliefs that they are “not any good” or are “unworthy.” Therefore,
in the intervening time and whilst new thinking and beliefs are “gaining ground”, we
encourage clients to be compassionate toward themselves, to thank their old beliefs
for reminding them of the risks, while reassuring the old beliefs that it will be okay,
as the new beliefs are here to help.

Conclusion
CBT has developed into cognitive behavioral coaching. The approach can help
clients better understand the relationship between their emotions, beliefs and behav-
iors. In this chapter we have explored the application of cognitive behavioral
coaching using the ABCDEF model and how the approach can help clients become
more effective thinkers and remove internal blocks to actions, performance and
success.

Cognitive Behavioral Approach and ABCDEF Model

Chapter 18
Gestalt Approach and Chairwork
Introduction
The Gestalt approach aims to help clients to reconnect with their ‘whole selves’, to
understand their physiological reactions to the issues, as well as their thoughts and
feelings, and how these affect them in the here and now. Gestalt coaching encour-
ages clients to identify and reﬂect on their patterns of behavior and through their
insights to test out new ways of being, before implementing these changes to their
lives. In this chapter we will aim to explore the gestalt approach, and how the
approach can be adapted to work with coaching clients, with a speciﬁc focus on
Chairwork, a tool which can be used to help clients take alternative perspectives and
express their thoughts and feelings to other stakeholders within the coaching
conversation.
The Model
The word gestalt has its origin in the German word meaning “form” or “pattern.” In
terms of psychology, the perspective of gestalt aims to explore how meaning takes
shape in human perception. One well known example of this type of research is the
illusion. Examples such as the “old woman-young woman” image, “Rubin’s Vase”,
the waterfall and Penrose stairs are well known and illustrate how our brain can make
sense of information which is presented to us in more than one way, although on ﬁrst
inspection we sometimes ﬁnd hard to see more than one image in these illusions
(Fig. 18.1).
These ideas about wholeness, and the relationship between parts, were developed
by Fritz Perls in his work with clients during the 1940s and 1950s. For Perls, Gestalt
offered a way of being, that led to the development of presence with his clients.
Unlike behavioral or cognitive behavioral coaching, Gestalt coaching does not offer

133

a speciﬁc model, such as GROW or ABCDEF. Instead, like humanistic approaches,
it focuses more on the relationship, and uses this as a basis for exploration of the self.
Key aspects within Gestalt are how beliefs, values, and attitudes affect people’s
relationships, how they respond to change and therefore impact on the organization
and its stakeholders. The approach aims to promote discovery, where more rational
approaches, such as cognitive behavioral approaches, may be less effective in
helping clients bring together the diverse thoughts and feelings about a topic.
Frequently, when coaches talk about gestalt coaching, they immediately think of
Chairwork, but there is much more to the Gestalt perspective.
Using a Gestalt perspective involves talking about the “ﬁgure of interest”—this
means the particular thing that a person is focused on and is interested in at a moment
in time. Where someone has an incomplete picture, they will seek to complete it with
their own perceptions. Gestalt provides an opportunity to bring different perspec-
tives to provide a deeper and more complete perspective situation.
Overall, Gestalt is “founded on the notion that human nature is organized into
patterns and wholes, and that the whole is more than the sum of its parts” (Gillie and
Shackleton, 2009). “Figure” and “ground” are key terms in Gestalt coaching. As
highlighted above, the ﬁgure is the focus of the client at that moment in time;
coaches are likely to see different ﬁgures emerging during the coaching session,
therefore it is the role of the coach to explore the ﬁgure, but also the ground, or the
context from which the ﬁgure emerges. The work of the coach is to help the client
develop full awareness of the ﬁgure and the ground.
The aim of the Gestalt approach is for the person to discover, explore and experience his or
her own shape, pattern and wholeness. Analysis may be a part of the process, but the aim of

gestalt is the integration of all disparate parts. In this way people can let themselves become
totally what they already are, and what they potentially can become. This fullness of
experience can then be available to them in the course of their life and in the experience
of a single moment. (Clarkson and Cavicchia 2013)
Gestalt-based coaching is underpinned by a number of related concepts:
•
Present-centered awareness: Awareness is seen as curative and growth produc-
ing. The coaching process follows the client’s experience, staying with what is
present and aware. It is essential that the coach is fully aware moment by moment,
and this is aligned to mindfulness. Practicing mindfulness is one way this level of
present-centered awareness can be developed.
•
Emphasis on the unique experience of the individual: Individual experience
comprises emotions, perceptions, behavior and body sensations, as well as
memories and ideas, and is honored and respected as being true for each
individual.
•
Creative experimentation: The collaborative efforts of the client and coach
promote growth and discovery through experimental methodology in which the
coach “tests” out hunches against the client’s experience and modiﬁes
accordingly.
•
Relationship: Relationality is central to the change process. Presence, dialogue,
and the visibility of the coach characterize the co-created relationship of client
and coach (Toman, Spoth, Leichtman, & Allen, 2013).
How to use Gestalt Coaching with Clients?
There are a number of ways in which to use Gestalt coaching:
Awareness: This can be used in terms of identifying what is going on “in the
moment” as data for the coaching conversation. This can be in a couple of forms, for
example: after noticing something about the client, the coach may say “When you
were talking about your line manager you were frowning; what were you thinking?
What were you feeling?” This can help bring to the client’s attention something they
hadn’t thought about—a thought or a feeling. The coach can then use their own
awareness to challenge, support or as a line of enquiry to help deepen the client’s
awareness.
Alternatively, the coach may reﬂect back something they notice about a feeling
they have—“I am feeling anxious at the moment, and I wonder what that might
mean.” Or, if the client says they are feeling a certain way e.g. anxiety in a certain
situation—the coach may then encourage them to explore this by asking “Where in
your body does the anxiety sit? What physical sensations do you have?” Asking
clients to explore body sensations brings a much deeper awareness. Many coaches
focus on the cognitive and rational thoughts when a greater awareness of bodily
sensations can bring new data, and insight, thereby opening the door to change.

Tools and Techniques
Chairwork
Chairwork is possibly the best-known technique drawn from Gestalt and is now
widely used within other approaches, sometimes using different names such as
“Perceptual Positions” or “Empty Chair.” The approach can be used with clients
under a range of circumstances but works well when the client has a strong stance on
a topic, but others might hold different perspective or interpretation of events. It
works particularly with clients who are experiencing conﬂict in the workplace.
The coach begins by placing an empty chair near to the client and inviting them to
imagine the person they are in conﬂict with is sitting in this chair. It’s helpful for the
client to provide some background to the relationship, and how each of the parties—
they and the other person—are feeling and what has happened recently between
them. The Typical Day technique (see Chap. 34) might be useful to understand the
relationship and typical interactions as preparation for Chairwork. This would
involve inviting the client to describe in as much detail as possible a typical day
when working with, or being with, this person. What is important is to focus on the
detail and not to race through the story providing a summary.
Returning to the empty chair, the coach invites the client to “bring the person into
the room” by describing this individual as vividly as possible: what they look like,
what they might be wearing, what smell might be present, how they would be sitting,
how they move. The next stage is to invite the client to speak to the other person—to
say whatever they want and need to say and however they want to say it. It is helpful
to remind the client of the conﬁdentiality clauses, and that they can say whatever
they want with no consequences.
The client may speak for a few minutes, or longer. This may be calm explanation
of their opinion or a torrent of emotion. The engagement depends on the client’s
style and hidden relationship between them and the other person.
At the end of the communication, and a period of holding the silence, the coach
can follow this up with “What more would do you want to say?” The coach can
repeat this until it is clear that the client has ﬁnished everything they want to
communicate to the other person. For some clients this can be a cathartic experience,
releasing built up tension and things they wished they could say. The coach can then
pause at this stage and invite the client to reﬂect on how they now feel about the other
person. This exploration can again take a few minutes or half an hour.
The next step is to invite the client to sit in the other person’s chair. It helpful if the
client thinks about the other person’s posture and style. Invite the client to reﬂect:
What do they see? How do they feel? What do they hear? What might they say in
response to what they have just heard? This element tends to be shorter but can be
equally powerful as the client sees the world from the other perspective. We ﬁnd it
helpful if the client addresses the empty chair as themselves, using their own name,
and staying in role for as long as possible.
136
18
Gestalt Approach and Chairwork

A third, and optional step, is to invite the client to move away from the two chairs
and occupy a new perspective, standing outside and at some distance from the
relationship. Explain this new perspective as someone who is outside of the rela-
tionship, and who is independent from it. Independence is important as some clients
want to select someone who shares their viewpoint, which offers little to broadening
the clients’ understanding of the whole. This position provides a third perspective. In
some cases, this perspective (person) does not have a view, or even awareness that
there is an issue. This lack of awareness can be itself be interesting to explore and
provides insight about the bigger picture.
The ﬁnal step is to invite the client to return to their original chair and ask them to
reﬂect on the different perspectives. What do these perspectives tell them about the
whole? How might they want to move forward? On occasion, it can be helpful to
offer the client the opportunity to speak again to the Chair. To act out, or rehearse,
what they might say to the other person, as a way to move the issue forward.
This approach works particularly well in a workplace conﬂict situation. It is also
useful when clients have relationship challenges. The approach provides a wider
perspective to clients and provides them with an “experience” (talking to the empty
chair) that changes the nature of their own subjective experience and perceptions
about the other person (Box 18.1 provides useful questions on Chairwork).
Box 18.1 Chairwork Useful Questions
1. What would you like to say to X?
2. What else would you like to say?
3. Now imagine you are X. Position yourself in the chair as they sit. Think
about how the speak and the words they use. Now what will X say in
reply?
4. What else would they say?
5. Now imagine that we are moving the other side of the room, imagine we
are an independent and slightly ambivalent third person (Y), outside of the
relationship. What would this person say to you both?
6. What else would they say?
7. As we return to your original Chair, what does it feel like to be X?
8. Why might X feel like they do?
9. As you think about the perspective from across the room, what might
those outside feel about the situation?
10. As you reﬂect on what was said and these different feelings, how do you
now make sense of this situation?
11. What would you like to do next?
12. Can I invite you to say a few words, based on what you have just said?
Imagine that X is sitting in front of you now.

Conclusion
Gestalt is a valuable addition psychological perspective helping us to invite clients to
consider other perspectives in their attempts to better understand the whole. It can
help clients gain a new perspective through the techniques like chair work. It has
been invaluable in working with interpersonal conﬂict and in supporting the
enhancement of workplace relationships. Overall, it can really support the client
when rational approaches have not worked or are not suited to the client or the
presenting issue.

Chapter 19
Solution Focused Approach
and the OSKAR Model
Introduction
While many of the other psychological approaches to behavioral change focus on the
problem, solution-focused approach challenges this mindset. The approach has its
origins in Brief Solution Focused therapy which avoids analyzing the problem and
instead encourages a focus on identifying solutions. Solution focused coaching, like
many of the other approaches described in this book has migrated from therapy into
coaching, but its future orientation and solution focus makes the transfer from
therapy to coaching an easy one. In this chapter we will brieﬂy explore the model
and how it can be applied in coaching through the OSKAR framework.
The Model
The Solution Focused approach has its origins in the work of Steve de Shazer, Insoo
Kim Berg and Yvonne Dolan in the Milwaukeeʼs Brief Family Therapy Center,
US. The Milwaukee counseling team was interested in how they could create more
impact by enabling more clients to access their services. They investigated the idea
of reducing the number of counseling sessions but increasing the intensity of each
session. Over the course of about 20 years, the team identiﬁed what was most useful
to clients in their work. This led to the development of brief solution-focused
counseling. In its pure form the approach uses three 50-min therapy sessions
which discouraged clients from talking about their past failures and focused attention
of future actions. Research evaluations by the Milwaukee team suggested success
rates as high as 86%, similar to rates achieved by other approached over 30 or
60 sessions spanning 6 to 18 months (de Shazer, 1991).

Solution-focused coaching can help clients to focus on what they can do to put
things right, rather than what’s wrong, and what can be achieved rather than what
may be considered desirable, or even unrealistic or unachievable.
This “forward orientated—solution approach” contrasts with the majority of other
psychological approaches. The traditional approach has been to encourage individ-
uals to look back at the past: to focus on understanding the problem and to explore its
cause through understanding the trigger and beliefs (cognitive behavioral
approaches), understanding their strategies for denial and defenses (psychodynamic
approaches) or simply provide a space for the client to reﬂect and share their
thoughts within a supportive, non-judgmental relationship (person centered).
Solution-focused practitioners argue that a problem orientation is more likely to
lead to blame, resistance, and conﬂict. While focusing on a solution is much better
suited for creating a collaborative environment where any past problem is overcome
by the will of reaching a common goal. This perspective is supported by research
evidence in coaching, which has conﬁrmed that solution-focused questions are more
effective than problem-focused questions (Grant and Gerrard, 2020).
Because the basic principle of the solution-focused approach is to help clients to
identify and design their solutions rather than analyze and solve problems, the coach
needs to remain future focused; paying attention to the client’s notion of how they
want their life to be different in the future. The coach also needs to trust that the client
is the expert; they are the one who is ﬁnding their own best solution, as opposed to
what the coach might consider to be the right solution. It is also helpful for the coach
to encourage the client to focus on their strengths and resources, reﬂecting upon and
thinking through how they have solved problems in the past, when they have been at
their best. Finally, having identiﬁed a desirable outcome, the coach helps the client to
recognize that progress towards the miracle in the real world is achieved by small
steps.
Of course, it can be cathartic to talk about the problem and important for the
client, but the skill of the coach is to help clients move from what is often labeled
within the approach as a “problem island” to a “solution island.” The aim of the
coach is to help the client identify the simplest and easiest path to achieving their
objective.
OSKAR Model
The OSKAR is a framework that can be used to structure a solution-focused
coaching conversation (Jackson and McKergow, 2007). The model is similar to
GROW, providing a series of letters as a handrail to structure the conversation and
help the coach stay on track.
The model incorporates a number of the commonly used tools in a solution-
focused approach, including scaling. Other commonly used tools are the miracle
question, which we have included in our techniques section in this book.

Tools
While the solution-focused approach is very simple, it can be more difﬁcult to put
into practice (Grant, 2016). The coach typically draws on a list of frequently used
tools.
Exclusive focus on solutions: the coach avoids being drawn into discussions
about the problem. They listen until there is a hint of a solution and use this as the
element to reﬂect back to direct the conversation forward. This avoids the session
drifting into therapy or a focus on the past.
Explicit goal: the coach ensures every conversation has a clear goal from the start,
with a clear measure of success.
Tools
141

Scaling: the coach uses coaching to help the client reﬂect on and evaluate their
experience. This may involve asking the client to evaluate how close they are to
achieving their goal: “On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the complete solution, and
1 representing the worst, where would you say you are?” Or it can be used to clarify
goals: “What does a 6 look like? How would you know you were there?” Or plan
small steps: “So what would be different if you were at a 6.5?”
Exceptions: No matter how bad a situation is, there will usually have been a time
when things went well or at least were not so bad. The coach invites the client to
focus on such a time and switches the clients’ thinking toward a more positive
orientation, with the aim of moving forward: “Tell me about a time when the team
worked well on a task.”
‘Do more of what works’: Once the client has identiﬁed times when the problem
is less pronounced, the factors in this situation can be identiﬁed and the client
encouraged to do more of this, and thus by implication do less of what they ﬁnd
does not work.
Afﬁrming: the coach looks for ways to acknowledge and afﬁrm the client through
genuine positive feedback. The coach aims to “catch the client doing it right” and
reﬂects this back. Such feedback can help clients build self-esteem and conﬁdence.
This can be incorporated into a more detailed framework for a real coaching
conversation.
Reframing: the coach may help the client during the conversation to reframe their
thinking to open up more possibilities and draw the client toward the resources they
have available.
Client: “I really hate my job”
Coach: “It sounds really unpleasant, tell me about which parts of the job are the
least unpleasant for you”
Miracle question: this technique is the most commonly associated with the
solution focus approach but has multiple variations. The classic question developed
by de Shazer (1991) invited the client to think about an overnight miracle: “Let me
ask you a strange question . . . which many people ﬁnd helpful: Imagine that when
you go to sleep tonight a miracle happens and all of the difﬁculties you have been
having in this role disappear. Because you are asleep, you don’t know that a miracle
has happened. When you wake up in the morning, what will be the ﬁrst signs for you
that a miracle has happened?” This may be followed up with: “So, what would you
be seeing if that were so?”
However, both Adler and Erikson developed variations of this question within
their own work and these can provide the basis for questions depending on your
client and their perspective: “What would be different if all your problems were
solved?” (known as Adler’s Fundamental question) (Adler, 1925) Or “If you have a
Crystal ball and looked into the future, explain how what has happened has come
about?” (known as Erickson’s Crystal ball technique) (de Shazar, 1978)
For all of these reasons the solution-focused approach ﬁts well with coaching and
the ICF competencies. In Box 19.2 we have provided an illustration of solution
focused coaching and how some of these questions might sit together.

3. Exception:
“This sounds like quite a few problems are effecting the team’s prob-
lems, tell me about a time when the team did work well together?”
4. Reframing:
“It’s great that you can see some of the weaknesses in your team, tell me
about some of the team’s strengths?
5. Miracle question:

Imagine that when you go to sleep tonight a miracle happens and all of the
difﬁculties you have been having in this role disappear. Because you are
asleep, you don’t know that a miracle has happened. When you wake up in
the morning, what will be the ﬁrst signs for you that a miracle has
happened?”
“So, what would you be seeing if that were so”
6. Scale goals:
“On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is complete team dysfunction, and 10 is a
high performing team hitting all their goals, where are you now?”
“What would need to change for you to score this as a higher number?”
Conclusion
The solution-focused approach is a useful model for coaches which can deliver fast
paced change when time is limited. Its focus on the solution as opposed to the
problem can increase clients’ self-ratings of positive effect, increase self-efﬁcacy,
decrease negative feelings, and lead to the generation of more action steps.

Chapter 20
Systemic Approach and Force Field Model
Introduction
A system is a perceived whole whose elements ‘hang together’ because they continually
affect each other over time and operate toward a common purpose.
Senge et al. (1994)
A systems approach can describe how the client’s scope of attention might
expand beyond that of their immediate goal and extend to include factors such as
their role, the team, the organization, industry sector, economic sector and even
national, cultural and historical background. Having some level of understanding of
and sensitivity to these factors are useful for helping the client to recognize that they
are situated within a speciﬁc and unique context. Such factors might be considered as
“forces” which inﬂuence how they and others act. By understanding these forces,
clients can recognize and manage the factors which they can control and learn to
appreciate and understand they are sometimes only part of a wider system which
they and others cannot control.
The Systemic Approach
Systemic approaches can be traced back to the 1970s and the work of writers such as
Peter Checkland, a UK academic, who was interested in ‘soft systems’ and the
challenges faced by managers within the systems. The Soft Systems Methodology
(SSM) was developed from earlier systems engineering approaches and its primary
use was the analysis of complex situations where there were divergent views about
the deﬁnition of a problem and therefore its possible solutions. The situations were
described as “soft problems” such as: “how to improve the provision of healthcare
services,” or “how to address the issue of homelessness amongst young people.”
That is, these are complex situations where the speciﬁc issue to be addressed may not

145

be immediately clear or even wholly agreed upon. As such, the SSM approach seeks
to explore the systemic considerations of a situation as opposed to applying a more
linear form of problem solving.
More recently other writers have explored systems thinking from a range of
different perspectives. Oshry (2007a, 2007b) has brought many of these ideas to
life through his work examining organizational systems and the role that different
characters play. As a playwright as well as a consultant and writer, he described
some of these characters as: Tops, Middles, Bottoms and Customers. He notes that
many people play different roles, sometimes at the same time but in different
relationships, sometimes over time during the course of their careers. What is notable
is that one can identify certain common challenges and themes associated with
playing a certain role.
Tops have designated responsibility (accountability) for some piece of the action
whether it is the whole organization, a division within it, a department, a project
team, or a classroom. They are usually tasked with implementing a vision. They have
all the responsibility but feel that no one does as they ask. They can feel that others
are not listening, that they are ignored and, as a result, can feel and become isolated.
Bottoms are usually embedded deep within a team with a remit to carry out tasks,
they think higher ups ought to be taking care and provide them with information but
fail to do so. They feel as though they are kept in the dark from wider communica-
tions and what is going on in the broader organization. Middles experience
conﬂicting demands from all sides. Bottoms demand resources and information,
while Tops demand action. Middles feel they can never satisfy both groups and
struggle to balance delivery and meeting targets alongside the need for the training,
resources and information needed to achieve that delivery. Finally, Customers are
looking to some other person to provide a product or service in order to move ahead
but feel continually let down by the ‘system’.
The principle of this work is that even in the most complex, multilevel,
multifunctional organizations, each of us is constantly moving in and out of
Top/Middle/Bottom/Customer conditions. In each of these conditions there are
unique opportunities for contributing to total system power; and in each there are
pitfalls that readily lead us to forfeit those contributions.
The Systemic Approach in Coaching
The systemic approach in coaching offers a powerful additional scope of attention
and consideration when working with our clients. To bring this alive, writers like
John Whittington (2012) have developed approaches that are well suited to use in
one to one conversation, such as constellations, while others have focused on
systemic team coaching approaches (Hawkins, 2017, 2018). These approaches
help clients consider and work toward their coaching goals through an exploration
of the context and system within which they ﬁnd themselves.
146
20
Systemic Approach and Force Field Model

In coaching, as noted in the introduction, the concept of a system could include
considering areas such as the client’s role, the team, the organization, industry sector,
economic sector and even national, cultural and historical background. Each of these
aspects can imply or even impose explicit and implicit “rules” such as legal or
regulatory constraints or simply “how we do things around here”, i.e. the organiza-
tion’s culture. Whittington’s approach seeks to identify an uncomplicated path or
way to understand and navigate what can be a potentially complex situation or
subject for the client. This is done by identifying the key component parts to the
client’s system and creating a constellation.
The ﬁrst stage of every constellation is mapping. Mapping gives clients access to
the system-level information and enables them to see and understand their place in
that system. The mapping process can allow what is beyond words to be articulated.
It also allows clients to go a step further by testing options and ideas to explore the
impact they would have on themselves, their goals, and the system itself. Once
mapped, the coach can invite the client to start exploring the relationship between
different parts or characters including the client and their network, as well as
non-human entities such as projects, roles and cultures.
This inquiry enables what is implicit and unconscious to surface and be conscious
and more fully understood. By creating a physical representation, the coaching
conversation can come alive in a new and dynamic way and help clients to develop
plans for the way they manage the system and themselves within that system. The
constellations approach to systems coaching is not only useful for one to one client
work. Creating and developing constellations is a powerful way to work with teams
and groups, shedding light on team and group dynamics, patterns and processes in
service of more effective working practices and relationships.
Peter Hawkins has popularized how the concept of coaching can contribute to
team development. Hawkins proposes that team coaching combines individual
coaching and consulting with inspiration from sports coaching. High functioning
sports teams respond to stressful moments instantly because they practice their
responses and therefore execute as a team rather than a collection of individuals.
In an increasingly complex business and organizational world, leadership teams
must work together across departmental divides, professional disciplines and geo-
graphic border. They must also contend with and navigate some of the other
systemic “lenses” already noted. As a result, and in order to develop high-
performing teams, leaders need to address seven challenges:
1. Balance the needs of various constituents
2. Handle tactical jobs and strategy
3. Cope with conﬂict
4. Wear multiple hats
5. Develop perspective
6. Manage virtual employees
7. Prioritize the connections rather than the parts
This last point embraces the concept of team coaching in that it focuses on the
behavior of the team more than on the work of the individual members of the team.
The Systemic Approach in Coaching
147

Team coaching is therefore still a one-to-one process as opposed to a one-to-many
process: one coach, one team.
Hawkins advocates that in leadership team coaching, coaches must effectively
apply eight skills:
Box 20.1 Hawkins: Eight Skills of a Leadership Team Coach
1. Storming—The coach supports the team as its members learn to work
together.
2. Team building or forming—Coach and team focus on its mission and
goals.
3. Team facilitation—One member takes ownership of the process so other
members can focus on the job.
4. Team process consultancy—The coach observes how the team works
together.
5. Team coaching—The coach helps the team learn.
6. Leadership team coaching—The coach assists the team in understanding
its impact on the organization’s constituents and stakeholders.
7. Transformational leadership team coaching—The coach helps the team
change the organization into its next incarnation. “One CEO described this
as having to navigate the ship through stormy seas while rebuilding the ship
at the same time.”
8. Systemic team coaching—The coach focuses on factors that improve or
detract from a team’s performance.
This last skill speaks directly to the kinds of organizational factors that we have
already referenced, and the skillset is underpinned by a team coaching process called
CID-CLEAR:
Box 20.2 Hawkins’s CID-CLEAR Team Coaching Process
•
Contracting 1—The coach holds an initial discussion about the team’s
understanding of coaching, and everyone works toward an agreement about
what the coach’s job entails.
•
Inquiry—In this data-gathering phase, the coach learns about how the team
works.
•
Diagnosis and design—The coach analyzes the data from the ﬁrst two
steps.
•
Contracting 2—The coach and the team create a contract describing the
team’s goals for the coaching process.
•
Listening—The coach examines the issues identiﬁed in the previous step,
while remaining alert to verbal and nonverbal feedback.
(continued)

Box 20.2 (continued)
•
Explore and experiment—The coach and the team construct new ways of
behaving that address the issues they have identiﬁed.
•
Action—The team takes the knowledge it’s gained and puts it into practice,
sometimes using “SMART (speciﬁc, measurable, actionable, realistic and
timely)” action steps.
•
Review—In this ﬁnal step, the coach and team examine how the process
unfolded and make plans for the next stages.
A leadership team must consider the organization’s tasks and processes and the
intersection of internal and external concerns. This requires practicing ﬁve cyclical
disciplines and which the team coach can play a signiﬁcant role in supporting:
1. Commissioning: Team members deﬁne the group’s purpose and establish how it
will measure success. To coach a team in the commissioning stage, the coach
gathers data about the goals of the organization’s transformation plan, how the
team enacted the plan and what the members thought of the results.
2. Clarifying: The team develops and deﬁnes its mission, goals, values and pro-
cesses. In this stage, the coach helps the team examine why it operates, where the
organization focuses, what values mold the organization and what the team hopes
to become. This discussion helps team members own their goals and prepare to
execute the resulting plan.
3. Co-Creating: The team monitors how it functions as a whole, celebrates its
achievements and corrects any malfunctions. To achieve co-creation, the coach
looks at the team’s objectives and the measures it uses to assess success. The team
coach can observe meetings or help the team members process the results of their
work to help them stay on track.
4. Connecting: The team focuses on how each member connects with external
stakeholders. In the connecting phase, the coach helps team members look
outward to see how the constituents of the organization perceive the team’s
goals and results.
5. Core-Learning: Team members assess their performance and draw lessons from
their experience. The coach gives the team members feedback on their perfor-
mance and what they can change in the future.
Finally, Hawkins proposes that an effective team coach will develop at least the
nine capacities of:
1. Self-awareness
2. Self-ease
3. Staying in the partnership zone
4. Appropriate authority, presence and impact
5. Relationship engagement
6. Encourage

7. Working across difference
8. Ethical maturity
9. A sense of humor and humility
Force Field Model
One model based within systems thinking and which can be used by most coaches is
the force ﬁeld model. The Force Field (see Fig. 20.1) helps clients to consider the
systemic forces at work and develop plans to manage these. This involves asking
clients to identify, list and assess the strength of both forces for change (the desired
outcome) and those resisting change (the desired outcome).
The model is based on the work of Kurt Lewin and the forces for change (Lewin
and Dorwin, 1951). The model invites clients to think about the forces within their
system which are pushing for and resisting change. It invites clients to map these
forces, reﬂect on the power of each respective force and consider what actions can be
taken to manage, mitigate or magnify the key forces.
Step 1: Identify the Drivers
This step is about getting conﬁdence that there is enough energy and support for the
stated goal, and about seeing where that energy and support will come from.
The coach having got the client to state their goal, starts by encouraging the client
to think about the ‘drivers’ that will help make progress toward that outcome.
“Drivers” are any forces that can be a force to support the goal or push you in the
Desired Outcome:

right direction. They can be commitment and enthusiasm (from the client, their team
and other people’s), lobby pressure from others, events, and so on.
Start by identifying all the “drivers” for your outcome, for example by asking
yourself some questions:
•
What difference will this change make to me? What will I get out of it?
•
What will the organization get out of it?
•
What difference will this change make to people in my team, customers, sup-
pliers, shareholders and other stakeholders?
•
What’s in it for them? (e.g. your boss, your colleagues, your subordinates and
your family and friends)
•
Who wants me to make this change? Why?
•
Does this change ﬁt with any other changes that people and/or the organization
are making?
•
Are any events coming up that are particularly relevant to the change I want
to make?
•
Has anything happened recently that supports the need for me to make this
change?
•
Are there people who support and invest in me, who might be interested in
helping me to achieve the objective?
Step 2: Identify the Resisters
Once the drivers have been identiﬁed, the next step is to consider the resisters. The
“resisters” are the people, feelings, events, and forces that will hinder the achieve-
ment of the goal. Invite the client to list all the “resisters.” Here are some questions to
help you identify them:
•
What sacriﬁces will making this change require of me? What will I have to give
up? How much will it cost me?
•
What negative consequences will my trying to achieve this objective have for
others? And if I am successful, are there people who will lose something as a
consequence?
•
What are the ‘obstacles’ to my change, and how powerful will their resistance or
indifference be?
•
Does this change conﬂict with any other changes that people and/or the organi-
zation are making?
•
Are there any events coming up that will get in the way?
•
Why haven’t I made this change before?
•
Do I have the resources I need to achieve the change? (time, skill, knowledge,
support)

Step 3: Assess the Strength of the Drivers and Resisters
Step three in the process is to map these by size onto a map of the forces (see
Resources section for the map). The length of the line can be used as a measure of the
size of the force.
Step 4: Manage the Forces
For step four invite the client what they can do to manage, mitigate or magnify these
forces to help achieve their outcome. Take each force in turn.
The output from the process is a plan of action for each of the force identiﬁed
through the process.
Systemic Coaching and the ICF Core Competency Model
The ICF Core Competency model outlines competencies which are relevant and
applicable to any approach to coaching, however the systemic considerations are
quite explicitly referenced in the model in several places:
Foundation Domain
•
Competency 1: Demonstrates Ethical Practice: Is sensitive to client’s identity,
environment, experiences, values and beliefs.
•
Competency 2: Embodies a Coaching Mindset: Remains aware of and open to the
inﬂuence of context and culture on self and others.
Co-Creating the Relationship Domain
•
Competency 4: Cultivates Trust and Safety: Seeks to understand the client within
their context which may include their identity, environment, experiences, valuers
and beliefs
152

Communicating Effectively Domain
•
Competency 6: Listens Actively: Considers the client’s context, identity, envi-
ronment, experiences, values and beliefs to enhance understanding of what the
client is communicating.
•
Competency 7: Evokes Awareness: Helps the client identify factors that inﬂuence
current and future patterns of behavior, thinking or emotion.
Conclusion
For clients who work within an organization, systemic coaching approaches allow
them to better understand their place within the system, how they relate to others and
how they can manage these relationships to achieve their goals. Some systemic
themes and challenges are explicit and some less so, and the role of the coach is to
help the client look at their goals and their situation through a systemic lens. This
helps to bring what was unconscious into more conscious awareness so that the
client can recognize that some of their challenges are based on systemic consider-
ations. Change can at times be limited to what the system will allow, and the
systemic approach helps the client to focus on what they can and can’t control,
what is an area they can work on for themselves and what is a product of the system
within they are operating. In this way, coaching can be more easily focused and
targeted on developing resourceful strategies that not only support the individual, but
which can also have a positive impact on the system at the same time. This is what is
sometimes known as the ripple effect of coaching and is closely linked to the rise in
popularity and success of coaching teams and groups as well as individuals.

Chapter 21
Psychodynamic Coaching and Transference
Introduction
Psychoanalytical consulting maintains the position that the presenting problem may at best
be a symptom and often is an issue that services to protect the real problem. (Czander, 1993)
Psychodynamic psychology has its roots in the therapeutic setting and is an
approach that focuses on the psychological forces that underlie human behavior,
feelings and emotions. It particularly focuses on the dynamic relationship between
conscious and unconscious motivation.
This chapter explores what psychodynamic means and how this approach how
can be applied to the ﬁeld of coaching. We will look at some practical psychody-
namic tools and concepts and will also see how the ICF Core Competency model
invites coaches to explore, uncover and work with the “real issue” with their clients.
What Does ‘Psychodynamic’ Mean?
It is surprisingly difﬁcult to ﬁnd a succinct answer which does not mislead or
obscure. Czander (1993) and Shedler (2010) offer deﬁnitions which approach an
answer: “The essence of psychodynamic therapy is exploring those aspects of self
that are not fully known, especially as they are manifested and potentially inﬂuenced
in the therapy relationship.”
This way of thinking about the human mind began with Freud at the end of the
twentieth century and has since developed and evolved to become the range of
therapies known collectively as ‘psychodynamic’.

The Evidence Base for a Psychodynamic Approach
to Coaching
In one methodological review of research (Shedler, 2010), considerable evidence is
presented that supports the effectiveness of psychodynamic approaches. Psychody-
namic psychotherapy is also particularly effective in the longer term, after the
therapy itself has ﬁnished. In similar ways, executive coaching aims not to resolve
short-term symptoms, but to build long-term, sustainable capability and promote
independence as opposed to reliance and dependency on the coaching process.
Shedler’s review outlines several key principles which can be usefully applied to
the context of coaching as outlined below.
The Containing Relationship
A psychodynamic coach prioritizes the psychological safety of the relationship
between themselves and their clients. This includes such contracting aspects as
clarity about conﬁdentiality, frequency and regularity of meetings, and privacy of
the encounters. It goes further than these important but rather practical matters,
however. The relationship between client and coach needs to become one in which
the client feels it is safe to discuss the “undiscussable,” that they will not be judged,
that their vulnerability will not be exploited. The relationship needs, in short, to
function as a reliable container into which they can pour half-formed thoughts and
shameful feelings with no fear of the coach’s reaction.
Emphasis on Self-Awareness and Self-Determination
In psychodynamic coaching, it is the client who leads the way. It is their insights and
resolve that determine what will happen. Not only that, but if they develop self-
awareness and self-determination, then these gains can remain long after the pro-
gram of coaching has ended (Sandler, 2016).
Respect for the Unfathomable Complexity of Mental Life
The psychodynamic coach knows that the enterprise they and their client are
engaged in is one of understanding more of what is currently unknown in the client’s
inner world. The coach may catch glimpses of this inner world, but they can never
know for certain. They may offer hypotheses, always tentatively, always ready to
hear the client’s response. They may say, “I wonder if. . .,” or “I’m thinking
156
21
Psychodynamic Coaching and Transference

perhaps. . . .” By exploring and remaining open to all sorts of fantasies, daydreams
and apparent tangents in the client’s thinking, the coach can enable the client to
begin to appreciate much more of their inner world.
Exploring Emotion and Intellect
Much of the emotional life of executives is kept private, through habit, fear, shame,
and a multiplicity of other cultural and individual factors which seek to deny the
importance and prevalence of feelings. The psychodynamic coach will spend at least
as much time encouraging exploration of feelings as thoughts, knowing that it is the
experience of emotion that enables change. It could be said that unexpressed emo-
tions will never die. They are buried alive and will come forth later in uglier ways.
As a client becomes more aware of the feelings which are causing their behavior,
they also may begin to feel differently, and to see possibilities for responding
differently.
Exploring Attempts to Avoid Painful Thoughts and Feelings
As part of expanding the client’s awareness of what is currently out of their
awareness, the psychodynamic coach is interested in the habits they have for
avoiding painful thoughts and feelings. If the coach can encourage the client to
recognize the thoughts and feelings they have been avoiding, they may well arrive at
a point of emotional insight which produces change.
Focus on the Here and Now
Psychodynamic coaches are interested in the pattern of relationship which develops
between them and their clients (transference and countertransference). These pat-
terns have the potential to shed a great clarifying light on some of the most
intractable relationships in the client’s professional life. For example, if the client
is always late for sessions when the coach is always on time, that pattern may serve
some function for the client in their life generally. Perhaps the client fears rejection,
and so positions themselves as the one who is doing the rejecting? Perhaps they are
concerned that they will not be given sufﬁcient attention, and so they make people
wait for them? It is in exploring this behavior with a safe and trusted relationship
which can make it possible for the client to appreciate more of the unknown in
themselves.
The Evidence Base for a Psychodynamic Approach to Coaching
157

Emphasis on Relationships
Through this kind of work the psychodynamic coach creates the possibility for
greater ﬂexibility in interpersonal relationships generally. Not only does the client
become aware of their motives for, and the impact of, their current choices, but they
have the opportunity to develop new ways of relating within the context of a safe
relationship with the coach. Since the vast majority of issues that the executive
brings to coaching are at least partially to do with their interpersonal relationships,
this is a great strength of the psychodynamic approach.
Fancy Dress Party Question
The fancy dress party is ideal for exploring relationships, and particularly unpacking
aspects which are outside of the conscious awareness of the client.
Box 21.1 The Fancy Dress Party Question
The coach invites the client to image they are going to a fancy-dress party
with the other person: who would they go as? This can be followed by a
question to explore what might happen at the party and why the client selected
the characters and events shared.
In reﬂecting on their choice and telling the story, interesting insights can
emerge about how they view another person, how they view themselves in
relation to that other person, and the story which is unfolding.
A coaching conversation session can unpack these insights and the aspects
of the relationship(s), and implications for how they might choose to reimag-
ine the relationship(s) or how they can adapt their behaviour to achieve better
outcomes.
Identiﬁcation of Recurring Patterns and Themes
Psychodynamic coaches work to identify and explore recurring patterns and themes
in the client’s thoughts, feelings, self-concept, relationships, behaviors and experi-
ences. In some cases, the client may be acutely aware of these patterns and yet feel
unable to avoid them (e.g. the client knows that timekeeping is a critical aspect to
building a good relationship with their manager and yet, try as they might, they seem
unable to arrive on time). In this case, the coach might invite the client to explore
what is underneath that pattern of behavior, what does being late represent for the
client and their relationship with their manager? In other cases, the client may be
unaware of the patterns and the coach helps them to recognize and understand them.
158
21
Psychodynamic Coaching and Transference

Exploration of Fantasy Life
With the psychodynamic approach, part of the coaching process might include an
exploration of the client’s hopes, desires, dreams and visions. The client shares
freely and fully, leading to the exploration of options and possibilities. This approach
can be likened to the coaching “miracle” question: “what if anything were possible?”
and also has resonance with Boyatzis’s Intentional Change Theory (2008) and the
discovery of the “Ideal Self.”
By way of bringing these principles together, if we consider that a person who
presents themselves for coaching may feel puzzled or challenged. They want change.
But then again, they do not. They may seem, to an external observer, to resist
change. Even when the coaching begins well, and all has been progressing for
some time along a smooth and beneﬁcial path, suddenly they resist and seem to
sabotage their own intent. It is precisely at that point that the insights from psycho-
dynamic thinking can be most useful to client. By becoming clearer about all of their
thoughts and feelings, including those outside of their immediate awareness, the
client can begin to remove the barriers to change which have held them back.
The psychodynamic approach in coaching therefore offers clients great scope for
self-discovery, using their insights in that process to enable understanding and
change. Sandler (2016) proposes that psychodynamic coaching can support coaches
to:
•
Understand their clients in depth, including those thoughts and emotions that lie
‘below the surface’
•
Forge strong working relationships with their clients that rapidly engage them in
the coaching process
•
Promote signiﬁcant, observable improvement in their clients’ behavior and per-
formance at work
•
Help clients to remain effective and skillful even when under pressure
Psychodynamic Concepts Useful in Coaching
There are four particular concepts in psychodynamic theory that we feel are note-
worthy, and which can have relevance and use in the context of coaching.
Projection
Projection can be deﬁned as our tendency to ‘act out’ our feelings, unintentionally, in
a way that “infects” others with the feelings we, often unconsciously, have. This act
of projection is often a defense mechanism in which our ego defends itself against
those unconscious qualities or impulses (positive or negative) by denying their
Psychodynamic Concepts Useful in Coaching
159

existence in ourselves whilst attributing them to others. For example, a leader may
feel uncertain and vulnerable in their role. They deny these feelings in themselves
and “project” them onto their line report, chastising and confronting them for their
lack of conﬁdence, decision-making and assertiveness. What this means for us as
coaches is that our own feelings in our clients’s presence may give us useful
information about our client’s inner world. The question: “what is mine and what
is theirs?” comes to mind.
Transference
This can be described as our tendency to ‘transfer’ feelings we have in relation to a
signiﬁcant person in our past and/or present onto others who remind us of them. So,
for example, if our mother disappointed us, we may anticipate being disappointed by
women in general. In coaching, we might remind our client of their brother, sister, an
old boss, a friend and this resonance can lead them to respond and engage with us as
if we were that person, like “putting someone else’s face” onto us. Naturally, this
process can have positive and negative implications for the coaching relationship
and can, of course, occur in either direction. It can also occur for the client with other
individuals within their system, thereby having implications for their relationships
with people in their network.
Countertransference
Countertransference is our tendency to respond to transference, not by noticing it
consciously, but by having feelings of our own. So, for example, if someone is
anticipating being disappointed by us, what we feel is an unusual anxiety to do
everything perfectly for them. This can be thought of emotional entanglement with
our client. What this means for us as coaches is that we must pay attention to our
feelings. Countertransference can be another source of useful information, or it can
get in the way of the work we need to do with our clients. In the example we have
been developing here, the coach’s countertransference might lead the coach to try to
meet all her client’s demands, rather than challenge him or her on his or her habit of
making unreasonable demands.
Parallel Process
Countertransference and the concept of unconscious emotional entanglement and
identiﬁcation between two parties are also linked to the idea of parallel process. First
described by Searle in 1955, it describes where the client can (unconsciously)
160
21
Psychodynamic Coaching and Transference

recreate or “parallel” their issue or challenge in the way they relate to their coach. In
this way, the work that the client brings into the coaching session “acts out” in the
moment, in that session. For example, the client is working on how they can be less
directive and more empowering with their team and the coach (potentially uncon-
sciously) ﬁnds themselves leading or directing the client more than is helpful in the
coaching process.
The role of the coach when working with a psychodynamic approach is to support
the client to make known the unknown. Looking at the Johari Window model (Luft
and Ingham, 1955) can be a useful way to describe this (see Fig. 21.1). In the
psychodynamic approach we may be working with the side that is unknown by self.
This information might also be either known or unknown by others and the coach
invites exploration with the client to uncover and make known information about
thoughts and feelings that help to reach the source of the work they are doing
together in the coaching relationship. In the case of the blind spot, part of the role
of the coach might be to offer observations of what they notice in the client regarding
patterns or themes etc. in order for the blind spot to be reduced, thereby increasing
what is “open” and known information. This exploration could also extend to
information that is indeed already known to the client but is hidden from others
and here the coach seeks to build sufﬁcient trust and psychological safety for the
client to feel comfortable for that information to be known in service of the client’s
forward movement toward their goals.
Another way of looking at this could also be to consider the “presenting issue”
and the “real issue”. When a client says that they want to work on their time
management because they are staying late at work every evening, is that simply a
case for better organization, delegation and prioritization throughout the day? Or
could it be that they are staying late because they feel insecure and lacking in
conﬁdence in their role and are staying late in order try and learn or achieve more
as they feel like the “weak link” in the team? Taking a psychodynamic approach in
coaching can help us to uncover what is really going on and what is the real piece of
work that we should be doing.

On the ﬂip side, we also need to take care that we are not slipping into what is
known as “conﬁrmation bias,” which is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor,
and recall information in a way that conﬁrms or strengthens our own personal beliefs
or hypotheses. In this way, self-awareness and self-regulation of the coach are
important qualities to develop and to continually check in and challenge ourselves
on. The question: “what is mine and what is theirs?” comes to mind again.

Psychodynamic Principles and the ICF Core Competency Model
163

Conclusion
In this chapter we have explored how psychodynamic psychology has many useful
applications to the coaching process. Whilst its roots are in the therapeutic setting,
the principles and concepts are very relevant when working coaching clients to help
them uncover and explore the information about themselves that is useful and
necessary for them to more effectively work toward and achieve their goals. We
have described what the psychodynamic approach is and shared its principles
through the lens of the coaching relationship. We have also looked at some of the
core concepts of psychodynamics and how this approach can also be found and is
reﬂected in some of the competencies within the ICF Core Competency Model.
We also want to offer a “handle with care” tag here. As coaches we can use our
understanding of psychodynamic concepts to be a more effective and resourceful
coach. However, we are not therapists. As one anonymous psychotherapy patient
said: “Psychoanalysis was probably the most interesting thing that I’ve ever done. I
learned an enormous amount about myself. Only problem is, I was more depressed
than when I started.” This approach is to help uncover useful information that is in
service of the client’s forward movement toward their coaching goals, it is not our
role or place to psychoanalyze them.

Introduction
Coaching has grown dramatically over the past two decades with a proliferation of
different models. While a number of coaching schools and coaches still adopt a one
size ﬁts all approach to their coaching, we have consistently argued throughout this
book that coaches are likely to be best placed to help their clients when they are able
to draw from a wide suite of different approaches and use a wide variety of tools and
techniques. Most coaches recognize the important of being able to ﬂex and adapt
their coaching to suit each individual client and the different topic each client bring
to coaching. This has led most coaches towards developing an integrated approach.
In this chapter we will look at the range of different coaching approaches and how
coaches can make choices about which model to select in which situation and
develop an integrated approach to their practice.
What Is Integration?
Humanity is diverse: We differ not only in our gender, ethnicity, nationality,
physical ability and looks, but also in personalities, preferences and experiences.
Its far to say that no two people are identically alike, not even monozygotic twins.
If that the case, why would we treat everyone the same in our coaching, using the
same model or framework with every client? Not ever DIY job at home requires a
hammer. But when the only tool we have is a hammer, ever problem tends to look
like a nail.
We believe in an eclectic approach where coaches learn a diverse range of
approaches. This may start with learning two or three frameworks or models during
their ACC training, and add one or two models as they progress toward their PCC
status. While there is no ideal number of models or frameworks which a coach must

165

use, drawing on 5–8 models will give coaches the ﬂexibility to be able to meet their
clients where they are, as opposed to forcing clients to adapt to their one model or
style.
But having a diverse range of approaches is only the start. Coaches need to be
able to make choices about which model to use when, and have an understanding of
how and when they may deploy these different approaches. This is Integration.
Integration involves bringing together the different approaches to create a coher-
ent way of working, while having the ﬂexibility to adapt to different clients and their
different issues. Integration involves synthesizing our mass of learning, of multiple
models, ideas about change, and different tools and techniques, to create a uniﬁed
whole, that is consist with our values and beliefs.
An Integrated Model for Coaching Practice
There are many ways of bringing together different approaches or models within
coaching. The following is just one way. You will have your own way of making
sense of what you do, which draws on your own experiences, training and practice.
One of the challenges for a new coach is to articulate their approach, so they have a
sophisticated answer to the question from a potential client: “So how do you coach?”
One that goes beyond: “Oh, I am a Time to Think coach”—even if they are trained in
Time to Think, and they use this as part of their overall practice.
This framework is based on a series of streams that the coach can swim, or work
within, moving between streams as required. The framework developed from prac-
tice, during the early 2000s (Passmore, 2007) and has continued to develop
over time.
The overall model consists of a pair of streams reﬂecting the developing and
maintaining aspects of the coaching partnership. Within this pair of streams are a
series of four streams that the coach can explore, working with the different facets of
their client—behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and physiological. All of this work
takes place within a systemic context (Fig. 22.1).
People have sometimes asked why use the term stream, as opposed to box,
category, or level. We prefer the term stream as this reﬂects the more ﬂuid nature
of the concept we have in mind, and the ability of the coach to be able to move easily,
from one to another, and back, as required. Secondly the concept requires that the
water in which we work is ﬂowing, moving, changing, which requires us to change
and adapt even if we stay within a single stream. We will review each stream in turn.

The Coaching Partnership
Before any coaching can begin, the coach needs to build a working relationship with
the client and to maintain this relationship throughout the course of the coaching
assignment. The coaching partnership emphasizes the collaborative and equal nature
of the coaching relationship. If either party is overly dominant, the coach is likely to
feel restricted in their ability to act. Alternatively, if the client feels threatened, they
are likely to be less open and willing to talk about intimate issues or may even
terminate the relationship.

Introduction
167

The ﬁrst of these two streams, Stream 1 involves the coach working with the
client to develop a relationship of mutual trust and respect. To create the right
conditions for coaching, the coach needs to invest in the relationship. This starts
from the very ﬁrst contact.
Psychological research tells us that our impressions of people are often formed in
the ﬁrst few minutes of an encounter. For the client this might involve reading the
coach’s bio or reviewing their website. What image would you want these documents
to present of you? Getting the tone and message right, is as important as your physical
ﬁrst meeting. These messages can build your credibility, provide reassurance and
provide a platform for the ﬁrst conversation, be it by email, phone or face to face.
For many coaching assignments the ﬁrst enquiry is likely to be by phone or email.
Taking the time to listen to the client, provide reassurance, clariﬁcations and
guidance will further help the relationship. Finally, when you meet, either online
or face-to-face, taking time to invest in the relationship before moving to action
provides the platform for future work.
The relationship building stream is likely to continue during the contracting
phrase, and into the story phrase where clients talk about their current situation
and what they want to focus on. During this phrase the coach works hard on three
aspects; being non-judgmental toward the client, expressing empathy, and being
non-possessive (Rogers, 1957).
However, once established this work on the relationship cannot stop. The coach
needs to continue to invest in this relationship. The focus though can begin to shift to
start to undertake the work required in the coaching assignment.
The coach thus seeks to create and maintain a safe container for the coaching
work. If that container breaks, or is not created in the ﬁrst place, the coach will be
unable to progress the work the client needs to undertake.
Working with Behavioral Issues
The third stream the coach can work in is the behavioral stream. This can often be a
useful place to start, helping clients to understand and gain conﬁdence in the
coaching process. In this stream the coach encourages clients to use simply
problem-solving approaches; to set clear and measurable objectives, think about
their current issue and develop action plans (usually things to do) which enable the
person to move closer to their goals. Models such as GROW (Whitmore, 1992) are
well suited to this space, being primarily behaviorally focused, they direct clients to
think of actions which they can take and to use mechanisms for accountability to
help them track their progress toward their stated goals.
Working with Conscious Cognitions and Emotions
The fourth stream is centered about the client’s thoughts and beliefs. How do these
help or hinder the client in their journey to achieving their goal? In this stream the
168

coach will typically draw upon cognitive behavioural techniques, such as those
developed by Beck (1976), Ellis (1998), Gilbert (2009) and Hayes (2004), which
have been reﬁned by coaches to make them more suitable for the work of the coach
(Neenan and Dryden, 2001; Edgerton and Palmer, 2005; Anstiss and Blonna, 2014;
Anstiss and Gilbert, 2014).
The aim of the coach is to help clients recognize the relationship between their
thoughts, feelings, sensations and their behavior. Through this, the coach can help
the client develop more helpful, supportive or evidenced based beliefs, or simply
become more accepting and compassionate toward themselves and, through this,
change their thinking to improve their performance or reduction their anxiety.
Working with the Unconscious
The ﬁfth stream is the work with unconscious cognitions. In stream four the client
may quite easily bring to mind the beliefs they hold, and the words used by their
inner critic that inhibit their performance or are a trigger for their anxiety. In stream
ﬁve the thoughts, beliefs and attitudes, and their relationship with their current
situation, are not part of the client’s conscious awareness. Often what has brought
them to coaching can be something completely different. The aim of the coach in this
space, working sometimes over many sessions, is to help the client to explore the
topic from multiple perspectives. Through this a greater self-awareness may emerge
and ultimately a desire to address the issue. Approaches such as psychodynamic
coaching or motivational interview can be particularly useful in this stream, helping
clients connect with often unspoken and unconscious drivers, helping the client to
connect with these core beliefs and values, where appropriate to challenge them and
to develop behaviors that are consistent with their core beliefs and values.
Work in this stream can be a slow and winding journey, where the coach’s
understanding of them self, as well as an understanding of others, can help the client
to uncover layer by layer deeper aspects of themselves, which have been hidden or
which lay undiscovered.
Working with the Body
The sixth stream to work with is the body. For some clients and some coaches work
in this stream is uncomfortable and beyond the boundaries of coaching. Antonio
Damasio’s work has demonstrated that Descartes was wrong to suggest a separation
of mind and body (Damasio, 2006). He has argued we are one, an integrated whole;
mind and body. Understanding our bodies and using them to enhance our perfor-
mance is thus important if as coaches we are working with clients to help them be
their best self.
In this stream the coach works with the client to help them become more aware of
their body and its physiological sensations. These sensations may be signals for
Introduction
169

current emotions, butterﬂies in the stomach in advance of a presentation, or sweaty
palms before a job interview. Or they may be signs of deeper and longer-term issues,
a shoulder or neck pain, a sign of stress. For example, one client we have worked
with was continually complaining of shoulder pain. While we did not know what the
issue was, we suggested he visit his doctor. A referral from his medical doctor to the
hospital led him to a triple heart bypass operation within the week. He was lucky that
the body gave him a signal before he suffered a massive heart attack, which could
well have cost him his life.
Work in this stream may involve somatic coaching or activities like the mindful-
ness body scan, which can help clients to make the connection between mind and
body and become better able to understand the messages their body may be
communicating.
Working Within a System
The ﬁnal stream that we have yet to discuss, but surrounds and inﬂuences all of the
others, is the Systemic stream: Stream 7. This stream includes the work team (but
also our family and friendship circle are other teams), the organization (this includes
the organization but also the wider network of stakeholders around their organization
from shareholders to suppliers), the sector (this includes professional bodies and the
profession), national society (which may set national laws or ways of working),
culture (this includes the modes of thinking and what is valued) and the environment
(the physical world, which imposes its own rules, from gravity to death).
These aspects become increasing invisible to the client as one moves from team to
environment. But these systemic inﬂuences inform, and sometimes drive, how we do
the things we do at this point in human history, in our national society, in our
regional culture, in our city, in our sector, in our organization, in our team and in our
family. The aim of the coach is to bring these unspoken forces into the clients’
awareness and recognize that systemic forces are both powerful and inﬂuence both
them and others. In short, the aim of the coach is to “make the invisible visible.”
Writers in this space, such as Oshry (2007a, 2007b), have provided fascinating
insights into how organizational forces can impact on individuals and what individ-
uals can do to both accept and manage these forces.
In this space the coach’s role is to encourage the client to see their actions in the
context of other stakeholders: “How would you feel if this appeared on the front page
of a national newspaper?” “What would your grandchildren think of your actions
looking back when they are sharing these stories with their children?” These
questions allow the coach to bring wider perspectives, encouraging greater open-
ness, transparency and accountability. We are sure that some of the actions at
Lehman Brothers would not have happened in 2007–08 if the spotlight of openness
was shone on these behaviors, and equally we might reconsider some of our
behaviors in the use of the earth’s ﬁnite resources if we thought we had to explain
them to our great grandchildren.

How Can Coaches Develop Their Own Integrated Approach?
While using a diverse range of approaches can help coaches to be able to adapt and
ﬂex to meet the different needs of individual client, how should the coach go about
developing their own integrated approach? The answer lies in what values and
beliefs hold together the different approaches that the coach uses with their clients.
A starting point for this model is equality: A core belief that the coach and client
are equals. Secondly, that the coach is working in the best interests of their client.
There are two riders to this. A recognition the client does not always know what they
want all of the time, and that sometimes the coach needs to encourage the client to
explore more challenging spaces or be confronted by unpleasant emotions to create a
change. Secondly, balancing the need of multiple clients. In many coaching assign-
ments the organization client may be paying for the coaching, while the individual
client may be in the room. This requires the coach to act transparently, encouraging
both parties to be open about their agendas and negotiating a shared agenda and
review process (we discuss this more in Chap. 24 on Contracting).
The thirdly belief underpinning the framework is that change is difﬁcult. It can
require failing and recovering several times, before the change is successfully made.
In essence coaches need to equip clients to be able to cope with lapses and relapses,
and to stay focused on the goal. This is best achieved through a positive and
encouraging approach, where the coach is willing to journey with their client,
allowing clients to fail and encouraging them to reﬂect on the experience and learn
what to do differently for their next attempt.
The ﬁnal core belief is that coaching is a brief affair. Each assignment is working
toward a clear objective and starts with the end in mind. It is not an indeﬁnite
on-going relationship.
New coaches may wish to consider three questions when reﬂecting on how they
will integrate their own approaches and develop a single coherent explanation of
their approach to coaching.
Box 22.2 Questions for Reﬂection
(i) What beliefs underpin your work with clients?
(ii) Which approaches models have you been trained in?
(iii) Which approaches do you feel competent to use and have you found
helpful with your clients and their issues?
For some, writing answers to these questions is the best way to think through and
develop their own approach. For others drawing their model works best. Either way,
as an integrated coach, be able to describe what you do and how you work with
clients.

Conclusion
In this chapter we have consider one integrated framework, the Seven streams
model, that draws together different approaches to provide a single coherent
model, underpinned by a series of core principles. This is just one way. Each
coach needs to discover for themselves how they make sense of their practice, and
how their can summaries and describe their own personal approach to coaching.

Part IV
Coaching Practice
Introduction
This part focuses on the practice of coaching. The ﬁrst of the four chapters in this part
is dedicated to ethics. Ethical conduct, integrity and professionalism are very high on
the agenda for good coaching practice. Codes of ethics guide coaching practice and
the behaviors of a coach. They also provide a framework that coaches commit to in
order to fulﬁl their ethical and legal obligations in their coaching practice. Chapter 23
looks at what is ethics and introduces the notion of ethical “dilemmas.” We also offer
an overview of the ICF Code of Ethics along with a useful model, called APPEAR,
to navigate and explore ethical dilemmas. The ICF Code of Ethics can be found on
the ICF website (2019a) and is the focal point of Competency (1) Demonstrates
Ethical Practice, which is covered in Chap. 6 of Part II.
Closely linked to ethics and professionalism is the process of contracting in
coaching. Chapter 24 looks at what is a coaching contract and also positions the
idea of frames as a way of outlining the different levels of expectation of and from
different stakeholders within the coaching process. A useful model of contracting
frames is covered to ensure that all relevant aspects are considered. We also look at
multiparty contracting and share thoughts on what should or could be contained
within a coaching contract.
Another very practical aspect of coaching is that of notetaking. In Chap. 25 we
look at the pros and cons of taking notes as well as important issues of managing
those notes, particularly in terms of conﬁdentially and data privacy and data protec-
tion. Our general position and recommendation are that notetaking is best kept to a
minimum for several reasons outlined in this chapter. However, we also offer some
hints and tips on notetaking and also offer a simple model called PIPS to help
coaches consider what notes to take.
The ﬁnal chapter in this part focuses on presence as a central feature of good
coaching practice. Coaching presence has already been positioned in two chapters of
this book (Chaps. 7 and 10) regarding how presence is an integral part of the ICF
Core Coaching Competency model. In Chap. 26 of this part, we look speciﬁcally at

how our coaching presence can be established, maintained and enabled through the
practice of mindfulness. We share some mindfulness approaches and techniques and
highlight their direct positive impact on several aspects of the qualities a coach is
expected to bring into coaching, both in terms of their being as well as their doing.

Part IV
Coaching Practice

Chapter 23
Ethical Practice
Introduction
All coaches come across ethical dilemmas in their practice. This may be about
whether they can work with two different members of the same team in an organi-
zation, or whether to report illegal practices to regulators. Ethics is about making
choice about what we consider as “right” or “wrong” and is an essential component
of good coaching as well as good leadership.
Most professional bodies, including the ICF, publish ethical codes of practice.
These codes provide advice as to what the professional body considers to be
acceptable conduct. They also provide a standard of practice which members of
the public can expect from their ICF coach. The implication for coaches is a failure to
comply could result in removal from membership or of a credential.
In this chapter we will brieﬂy explore what is ethics, and what types of ethical
dilemmas can arise in coaching. Secondly, we will consider the ICF code of ethics
(ICF, 2019a), and ways coaches can become more familiar with the code and its
application. Third, we will explore the limitations of professional codes of conduct,
recognizing that any attempt to codify ethics risks treating situations as black and
white cases. However, in reality coaches need to navigate ethical compliance in a
multi-colored world of ambiguity, half facts and multiple perspectives.
What Is Ethics?
Ethics is at its most simple about deciding between what is right and wrong. But
really what we mean is morally right” or “morally wrong,” as opposed to ﬁnancially,
commercially, or strategically right or wrong. Morality itself is concerned with the
norms, values, and beliefs embedded within society. Such norms, values, and beliefs
are often unspoken. They vary across time, culture, and organizations. What might

be considered acceptable banter 50 years ago at work, would be considered sexual
harassment today. What might be considered joking between colleagues in one
sector would be considered harassment in another sector. Coaches need to learn to
navigate the challenges of their professional code, their personal values and the
environments in which they work (Turner and Passmore, 2018).
What Are Ethical Dilemmas?
Ethical dilemmas are choices that occur when the answer about a future course of
action is unclear: “Should I do A, or should I do B?” In coaching these choices may
involve issues about managing, or when to break, conﬁdentiality; in what circum-
stances would it be acceptable to whistle blow on a client who has revealed during a
coaching session illegal activity in their organization? It may involve maintaining
appropriate relationships with clients: In what circumstances would it be appropriate
to go back to a clients’ ﬂat? In what circumstances would it be appropriate to go for a
drink with a client after a session? It involves conﬂicts between the needs of the
individual client and the organizational client who is paying for the coaching: In
what circumstances would it be acceptable to protect a client who is using their
employer’s resources to run their own business? In what circumstances would it be
appropriate to break conﬁdentiality to protect organizational IP from being stolen?
ICF Code of Ethics
The ICF publishes a Code of Ethics, which relate to individual coaches, and a Code
of Conduct, which relates to accredited programs.
The Code of Ethics is divided into ﬁve parts, with Part IV itself divided into four
sections which contain the real detail. The ﬁrst part is an Introduction which explains
the code and its position within ICF coach practice.
Part II deﬁnes coaching and sets out the context for practice of ICF coaches within
a professional relationship with clients. It helpfully differentiates between the indi-
vidual client and the sponsor, being the person responsible for commissioning the
coaching. We have summarized these in Box 23.1.
Box 23.1 Deﬁnitions
•
“Client”—the individual or team/group being coached, the coach being
mentored or supervised, or the coach or the student coach being trained.

Part III of the ICF code sets out the ICF Values and Ethical Principles, while Part
IV sets out expectations for coach conduct under four headings. The full ICF Code of
Ethics can be found on the ICF website (2019a). However, we would encourage you
to check the ICF website as the code is updated from time to time. The Code of
Ethics and ethical practice is also the focus of ICF Core Competency 1 which we
explored in depth in Chap. 6.
It may be helpful to look at two examples: conﬂicts of interest, conﬁdentiality and
making public statements and claims.
ICF Code of Ethics
177

A common challenge many coaches face is managing conﬂicts of interest. A
guiding principle that coaches can use is transparency. This involves the coach
making clear at the start who they are working with, such as coaching a manager
and several line reports or coaching several directors from the same board. It can also
relate to conﬂicts between multiple stakeholders, where the coach may be commis-
sioned by the organization to deliver one agenda, while the client believes there is a
second hidden agenda. By encouraging transparency by all parties, potential con-
ﬂicts can be minimized.
Research into coaching practices suggests there remains widespread misunder-
standing about what is acceptable and what is unacceptable practice (Passmore,
Turner, & Filipiak, 2018, 2019). Conﬁdentiality is often a source of confusion in
coaching. Many coaches still refer to coaching being completely conﬁdential, as if
the coach is the client’s priest and the coaching session a confessional conﬁdential
space. While conﬁdentiality is important, there is a danger that coaches prioritize this
over other obligations; such as their contractual obligations to the sponsor, and to
wider society. Conﬁdentiality does not mean protecting clients from their law or
ignoring danger signs where there are serious risks to the client or to others. We
would suggest coaches make clear during contracting both the conﬁdential nature of
coaching but also the limits of conﬁdentiality. Three key limits are serious crimi-
nality, risk of harm by the client to them self and risk of harm to others.
Judging the nature of a criminal offense is difﬁcult for those who are not involved
in the criminal justice system. One potential test of whether a crime is “serious” is:
“If I reported this matter to my local police station would the police actively
investigate the crime”? A second test is: “Does the offence carry a potential
custodial sentence?” This may be best illustrated by an example. Driving a car
above the speed limit is a criminal offense in most countries. However, reporting an
individual to the police who we have seen speeding is unlikely to be investigated,
unless an accident had occurred. In contrast, importing and selling hard drugs, such
as cocaine, is a criminal offense and if reported to the police would result in an active
investigation. Secondly, in most countries prosecution for this offense is likely to
lead to a custodial sentence.
In contracting with sponsors coaches need to agree when contracting some
general principles about what is conﬁdential and what the coach may be obliged to
disclose. This is a difﬁcult path to tread. The coach needs to be careful not to collude
with their clients against the organization or wider society, while also not being
overly inﬂuenced by the sponsor to share the details of each session. Some of these
aspects have been expanded and further articulated in the updated ICF Core Com-
petency Model, particularly in Competency 3. Established and Maintain Agreements
(see Chap. 8).
The third example relates to making public statements. This is one of the areas in
which the ICF receives the most complaints: A coach claims they are qualiﬁed in a
psychometric tool or makes a similar claim to a client or on their website, which is
not completely true. We would thus encourage coaches to read and think carefully
about public statements, and only make statements which are true or which can be
proved.
178
23
Ethical Practice

The ﬁnal Part of the ICF ethical code relates to Pledge, which summaries the
coach’s commitment to the code and to behave in an ethical way. Further informa-
tion on the ICF Code of Ethics and how it forms part of the ICF Core Competencies
are outlined in Chap. 6.
Continuing Your Ethical Learning
Having completed your training, you may believe you know all you need to about
ethics. This would be wrong. Like the development of coaching competencies,
ethical understanding and practice is a continual journey of development.
One helpful step after completing your ACC is to continue to engage through the
Complimentary Ethics course available on the ICF website. The ICF online course,
involves a short video and quiz. The course offers CCE credits and is a useful
steppingstone in the journey toward PCC status.
Working with Ethical Dilemmas in Your Coaching Practice
However, as we have suggested above, while Code are vital for setting out general
principles, they cannot cover every situation, circumstance or eventuality that can
arise between the coach and the client, or the coach and the client organization.
Instead coaches need to be aware of the Code and its contents. They need to be
trained in how the code relates to them and their practice and they need to develop
internal guides, or process, for working with ethical dilemmas, to guide themselves
to the appropriate response in the situations they encounter.
A heuristic is a rule of thumb, or an internal framework that helps us makes
decisions. Heuristics can be a valuable tool for coaches, guiding their thinking and
improving the quality and consistency of the decisions they make in their practice.
The APPEAR Ethical Model is one such model that can help in guiding ethical
decision making (Passmore and Turner, 2018). The APPEAR ethical model offers a
step-by-step process from encouraging coaches to develop their ethical antenna to
recognizing that making ethical choices brings with it consequences which we and
others must live with.
Box 23.2 APPEAR Six Stages
The model has six stages:
•
Awareness
•

•
Possibilities

Box 23.2 (continued)
•
Extending the ﬁeld
•
Acting on Reﬂections
•
Reﬂecting on Learning
The model is non-linear and thus the coach can step back to consider or engage
with elements more than once. The ﬁrst stage of the process is “Awareness.” For
high quality ethical decision-making, coaches need to be sensitive to identify
potentials risks or challenges to their practice that may carry with them a choice or
an ethical component. Having one’s antenna continually scanning the environment,
the relationship and ourselves is the starting point. Without this, potential ethical
issues can be missed, and the coach can act without consciously considering their
decision or the implications of their action or inaction.
We would also include in this stage of awareness, an awareness of the relevant
codes of conduct, of best practice, one’s own values and of the cultural and societal
norms: what’s acceptable and what is unacceptable, at this moment in time and in
this cultural, national or organizational context (Fig. 23.1).
We have already emphasized codes of conduct and how some coaches may be
members of more than one body and thus be bound by more than one code. Coaches
of course also need to be aware of these codes and how to apply it. Secondly, self-
awareness, which we stress elsewhere, is also important. What are your values, and
how do you maintain these? Thirdly, best practice. Sometimes best, or accepted,
practice can change very quickly, and the published code takes a time to catch
up. For example, the #Metoo movement in the US focused attention in a new way on
the power dynamic that can exist in some relationships and the need for greater
sensitivity in recognizing the role played by gender and age.
Values are also situated within a historical context, what may have been common
practice 50 years ago, may lead to dismissal in the modern workplace. Ethics also
varies between countries, what is acceptable in the USA, may be very different to
practices in the Middle East, such as a male coach offering to shake hands with a
female commissioning manager. The sector will also have an impact, with higher
expectations of public sector bodies than the private sector, and of regulated sectors
than non-regulated sectors. Finally, organizations may set different standards for
what they consider to be acceptable—whether that’s how they report their proﬁts or
the ethical standards they expect of their suppliers. There is likely to be vast
differences in ways of working in a small family start up in San Francisco to working
in for the government in Washington DC.
The second stage is “Practice.” While coaches engage in their roles, regular
reﬂection through supervision, journaling, or personal reﬂection can help develop
and maintain situational and self-awareness. While we have noted elsewhere super-
vision has an important role to play in coaching as a means to reﬂective practice,
coaches can and should reﬂect on their practice in multiple ways.
Stage 3 of the decision-making framework is the emergence of a dilemma and
considering the “Possibilities” around how to act. In some coaching roles dilemmas

can happen every week. In others, dilemmas may only emerge every few months, or
once a year. Of course, the more sensitive we are to possible dilemmas, the more
likely we are to spot them. The coach who never has any ethical dilemmas is most
likely to be a coach who lacks awareness.
The key action for the coach at this stage is to generate alternative courses of
action in response to the emergence of the dilemma. This may start with a dichot-
omy—“I can do A, or I can do B,” but as reﬂection deepens, and through conver-
sations with others such as a mentor or supervisor, multiple options are likely to
emerge.
At stage 4, “Extending the ﬁeld,” the individual should aim to work through the
options. This involves scenario development, “if I do X, what may follow would
be Y, and this can lead to A and B outcomes.” This exploration of the consequences,
both positive and negative, will help the coach to better understand the options
available, discounting less attractive options, and selecting the most ethical and
practical option given the circumstances.
The ﬁfth stage, “Acting on Reﬂection,” is about implementing the appropriate
course of action. This can take both courage and can come with unpleasant conse-
quences. These consequences may not just be for others, but the coach and their
organization too. For example, whistleblowing about an illegal action can carry with
it severe consequences. The coach may be criticized by the individual or threatened;
the organization may prefer to manage the situation internally. The coach may be
ostracized, lose their employment or the contract or suffer damage to their reputa-
tion. Sometimes, its right to let the coach manage disclosure, other times its
appropriate for the organization to manage the issue internally, while on other
occasions, only public disclosure is the right course of action. In coming to this
decision, deep reﬂection and discussion with a supervisor or a trusted colleague
can help.
The ﬁnal stage is for the individual to reﬂect on the learning that has arisen from
the events. This reﬂection should be at two levels: a reﬂection on the process and the
various stakeholders: What they have learnt as a coach from thinking through and
implementing this ethical action. Second, reﬂection on the issue and themselves:
What have they learnt about themselves as they encountered and worked through
this situation?
Conclusion
As we have suggested throughout coaching is a journey of development. Developing
ethical maturity is part of that process. The ICF Ethical Code is a starting point for
this journey. The next step is the ICF CCE course. Alongside of this, thinking about,
reﬂecting on, journaling and discussion in supervision ethical issues will raise your
ethical sensitivity and using a framework such as APPEAR alongside the ICF code
can help you navigate the challenges of coaching practice.

Chapter 24
Contracting with Clients
Introduction
Contracts are an essential element in the work we do with clients. They enable a
shared understanding between the main parties; the organizational clients who be
paying for the coaching, as well as individual clients. Research evidence (Passmore,
Brown, & Csigas, 2017) conﬁrms that a reasonable proportion of coaches don’t use
written contracts in their practice. While this varies between different forms of
coaching and different countries, we believe that written contracts and agreements
are an essential ingredient for successful coaching. A failure to use a written contract
or an agreement leads to the potential risk of misunderstanding about the nature of
coaching, how the coach will work and what the organization and the individual
client can expect, and what the coach can expect. More importantly it also fails to
provide a means for clients to hold their coach to account, what ethical standards can
the client expect to coach to follow, and how can the client complain about their
coach if they are unhappy. In this chapter we will explore the role of contracts, think
about the different forms of contract that may exist and what should be included or
excluded.
What Is a Coaching Contract?
A contract is a legal agreement setting out the terms between two parties. In coaching
this might take the form of a contract for services between the commissioning
organization and the organization supplying the coaching service. In other coaching
projects, it may be as simple as a written agreement between the individual coach
and the individual client.
In most projects it is likely there will be a number of ‘contracts’ working
simultaneously. There is likely to be a contract between the coaching or consulting

183

company and the commissioning organization. This is the legal agreement for the
service and is likely to cover issues such as indemnity requirements, payment terms
and compliance. Many organizations also issue Purchase Orders for work, which set
out the speciﬁcs of an individual task or series of tasks, such as “Undertaking
6 coaching sessions with Eva Gray between January and June.”
Aside from the legal agreement the coach is likely to discuss and explicitly agree
some key points about the coaching with both the sponsor (the person who has
commissioned the coaching) and the individual client. These discussions may be
held separately or together. Each of these “agreements” will contain references to
coaching and its expected outcomes. However, alongside these all parties are also
following many unspoken “agreements” about how to interact and work together.
Contracts as “Frames”
One way of viewing this series of contracts is as a series of frames. These frames
reﬂect the expectations the different stakeholders bring to coaching. Some may be
written, some spoken, while others are unspoken and may even be outside of the
conscious awareness of the parties involved, while still inﬂuencing how they
interact.
These frames operate at multiple levels. In the Eight Contracting Frames model
we suggest contracts operate from moment to moment to across the lifetime of the
stakeholders (Fig. 24.1). Let’s look at each of the frames in turn.
Frame 1 covers the interactions, moment to moment, in the coaching session.
Coaching is a social process. The coach and individual client are continually
re-contracting; renegotiating the coaching contract in the moment-to-moment inter-
actions. This contract relates to what is happening between them and what each part
considers “desirable,” “acceptable,” and “unacceptable” in the behaviors they dis-
play and how they communicate with each other. As an example, the level of
challenge the coach brings into a coaching conversation can grow in proportion to
the level of trust that exists between the two parties. When there is no trust, high
challenge can rupture the relationship. When there is high trust and high respect,
challenge can be seen as stimulating and cathartic. While few, if any, of these
elements will be explicitly covered in a written contract, they will affect the
relationship and the work the parties can do together.
Frame 2 relates to the “session contract.” A short contracting conversation at the
start of each session allows both parties to agree a shared view on the agenda for the
session. For example, does the individual client want to build on what was discussed
last time, or deal with a pressing issue that has arisen since they last met? It can also
be helpful for the coach to brieﬂy refer to the key terms of the contract, and check
nothing has changed. This “contracting” conversation may take sixty seconds but
provides a useful platform for each session. We see this an as essential agreement
and good practice for the coach to start the session using this checking-in process.
184
24
Contracting with Clients

Frame 3 and 4 are more likely to be written. Frame 3 covers the agreement
between the coach and individual client. Frame 4 refers to the agreement with the
organization (assuming someone else is paying for the coaching). Many organiza-
tions now have formal coaching contracts that the coach is required to sign. If not,
the coach should offer a written agreement, setting out the terms for the assignment.
We suggest in ﬁnalizing both, a tripartite meeting between coach-individual client
and organizational client, or the sponsor, will help ensure there is clarity and
transparency about the reasons for, and focus of, the coaching assignment. This
also provides a platform for a review meeting between all parties at the end of the
assignment.
We differentiate between the formal written contract between the supplier of the
coaching and the purchaser and the agreement between the coach and the individual
client. The written contract is a legal agreement and could be upheld by the courts. In
contrast we see the agreement between the individual client and the coach as being a
working document to help clarify how they will be working together. This document
thus does not need to be signed, but it is helpful for the coach to talk this through
with the individual client to check they are happy with it before the coaching

assignment begins. We also think it is useful for the individual client to be given a
copy of the agreement for future reference.
We suggest that these formal “contracts” are mediated through a series of other
unspoken “contracts,” or ways of working. These “contracts” inﬂuence how the
coach and individual client interact.
Individual clients work for an organization. This is true for most coaches. All
organizations, whether a one-person coaching company or a multi-national, will
have an organizational culture. This culture will inﬂuence how the organization
makes sense of and responds to customers, colleagues, its regulators, the govern-
ment, and its competitors. These are unwritten rules, and reﬂect day-to-day working
practice. In summary, organizational culture is “the way things are done around
here” (Deal and Kennedy, 1988) and is reﬂected in the everyday activities including
the coaching session.
The organization is also likely to operate within a speciﬁc sector, a national or
cultural setting and within a historical context. These unspoken ‘contracts’ inﬂuence
such issues from what people in the organization wear, how they greet each other
and what they can and cannot say to each other—for example do they wear a tie, a
T-shirt or a sword? The later might sound silly, but swords were standard issue
500 years ago, and the UK Members of Parliament still have an allocated space to
hang their sword when at work in the Houses of Parliament. Do they shake hands,
dap, kiss cheeks, bow, or give high-ﬁves? Different sectors, different countries,
different races, and at different points in history (or generations) speak, behave, and
interact differently. Effective coaches are aware of cultural differences as they move
from an Australian charity sector client to a French fashion house client, and from a
US civil rights organization to a Swiss private bank.
Multiparty Contracting
We believe that a tripartite, or multiparty meeting, before coaching starts can be a
beneﬁt for all parties. The meeting might include the coach, the individual client, the
sponsor (usually the line manager) and possibly the commissioning manager
(HR manager).
The coach’s role in this multiparty meeting is to facilitate the discussion. The aim
is to secure a shared agreement about what the coaching will cover and what
outcomes are expected from the process. Speciﬁcally, a list of goals, outcomes or
themes to be discussed agreed between the parties ensure there are no surprises later
in the process. A third useful element to discuss is conﬁdentiality, for example,
whether the sponsor is expecting a full written report at the end of each session or
accepts that the coach will keep content conﬁdential; and what information the coach
will disclose to the organization or other authorities, such as the police or health
professionals. This is certainly likely to be included where there is a risk of serious
harm, and issues where there is serious illegality, such as fraud, theft, or bribery.
Most large organizations are experienced purchasers of coaching, and many now
have bespoke contracts for coaching. However, if the organization is using a general
186
24
Contracting with Clients

consulting agreement we believe there is value in a written agreement setting out the
terms for the coaching work including the number of sessions, length the sessions,
contract value, payment terms and means of redress in cases of dissatisfaction, plus
the high level goals or focus for the work. This can be given to all parties at the end
of the multiparty meeting.
With an initial shared understanding in place the coaching work can begin. The
meeting also provides a platform for periodic reviews. On longer assignments, this
may include a meeting with the stakeholders at the mid-point to discuss perceptions
of progress and to refocus if needed. Whether there is a mid-point review or not, we
advocate a ﬁnal review meeting. The role of the coach in this meeting is to facilitate
discussion between the parties, and their perception on what has been achieved. The
coach in this meeting needs to take care not to be drawn into sharing conﬁdential
content of what was discussed or expressing an opinion on the individual client or
organization. Instead with skillful interventions the coach can draw out the views of
each party; the individual client, the sponsor, and the commissioning manager, to
help each to listen and understand each person’s evaluation of the coaching assign-
ment, and the next steps for each.

Conclusion
Contracting is an essential but often neglected aspect of coaching work. Get it wrong
and the coach is vulnerable to complaints from the client or the sponsor, or at least
failing to meet client expectations. Get it right, and it provides the bedrock for the
subsequent coaching relationship over the coming 4, 6 or 12 months of working
together.

Taking and Managing Coaching Notes
Introduction
Many coaches ask what best practice is in taking notes during a coaching session.
The ICF does not offer any speciﬁc guidance on note taking. Advice is limited to
maintaining the conﬁdentially of information and expecting coaches to be in com-
pliance with national legislation, such as data protection. In this chapter we explore
ideas around note taking and make some suggestions about when to take notes, how
much information to collect and how to store, manage and delete this data.
Should You Take Notes?
There is little speciﬁc guidance or advice from professional bodies, or from thought
leaders as to whether, or what, to make notes about within a coaching session or
afterwards. The main reason for this is that practices vary. There are few deﬁnite
right and wrong answers when it comes to note taking.
Most coaches only make brief notes during a session. There are several reasons
for this. The ﬁrst is taking detailed notes during a session can be a distraction. The
coach spends more of their time looking down writing, instead of making eye contact
and listening to their client’s full communication. As a result, it can appear the coach
is more interested in gathering evidence than engaging in the conversation. Such
behaviors can damage trust and intimacy and reduce client disclosure.
Secondly, our deﬁnition of coaching centers on facilitating client insight not
evaluating clients based on the information we have gathered. This is very different
from the many other activities the coach may have undertaken in the past, such as
interviewing, performance appraisals, or disciplinary hearings. In these situations,
the interviewer’s objective is to gather as much evidence as possible. The evidence
must be accurate and comprehensive. In coaching it’s all about the client and helping

189

the client to discover insights and great awareness, and through this to become more
aware of choices.
Some coaches do take detailed notes that run to several pages. The coach may
have been asked by the client to take notes for them, for example if they have a
disability or the coach may have been asked to write a report for the sponsor.
However, as a general rule we caution against, and instead encourage our client to
take responsibility for themselves and gather their own notes. In terms of sponsors
we encourage the use of tripartite meetings as the mechanism for review and
reporting back, where the client reports back to the sponsor instead of the coach,
with the coach facilitating this conversation as opposed to providing any input. In
this way, the workplace manager or line report relationship is intact and maintained
and the coaching process sits outside that relationship rather than in any way
replacing or replicating it.
What Should We Make Notes About?
To guide our thinking in what information to capture we use the “PIPS framework”:
•
Personal
•
Ideas
•
Plans
•
Suggestions
“Personal” issues are non-sensitive, personal details. For example, if the client
mentions the name of his partner, Kate, we would make a note. Or if their daughter,
Florence, is playing in a netball tournament the following week, we will make a note.
In this way we are able to ask about these aspects during the initial informal
conversation at the start of the next session. As an example, our notes might simply
read “Daughter; Florence-netball tournament at the end of month”, and I might ask:
“How did Florence get on in her netball tournament?” This helps build the relation-
ship and demonstrates the coach’s personal interest in the wider life of their client.
The second area is “Ideas.” These may be passing remarks that are worth
capturing and may be worthy of exploration at a later time. For example, while
focusing on one issue, a client may talk about the challenge of balancing work-home
priorities. My notes may simply record “Future topic: Balancing work-home prior-
ities?” In this area I would ensure I was careful not to use a label or a diagnosis to
describe client behaviors, such as “workaholic” or “narcissist.” There are a number
of reasons for this. Firstly, I need to be careful not to issue clinical diagnosis that I am
not qualiﬁed to use? Secondly, what evidence is there to conﬁrm such a diagnosis? I
probably only have limited information and am unlikely to have completed a
standardized assessment questionnaire for diagnosis. The ﬁnal and most compelling
argument however is regarding client access to my notes. What would be the
implications if the client asked to see my notes? In many counties there is a legal
right to see all personal data and the coach may have to release such information for
190
25
Taking and Managing Coaching Notes

the client to review it. We would thus suggest you keep in mind when making notes
that your client is going to read the notes after the session. This encourages you to
focus on the essentials and avoid straying into areas of speculation.
The third area for notes is “Plans.” At the end of a session we will typically ask
the client to summarize their insights or plans for action. We will encourage them to
make a note of this session, and at the same time as the client is writing we will make
a note of these for review after the session. These plans are likely to include not just
what the client aims to do between now and the next session, but also what barriers
and hurdles they need to manage, who will support them and who will hold them to
account. If you have a large client list, maybe 30 or 40 clients, this information can
be helpful for the coach to be able to recall at the start of the next meeting the actions
the client had agreed to explore as the starting point for the next conversation.
The fourth and ﬁnal area is “Suggestions.” These may be comments, feedback or
ideas from the client for the coach to action. There may have been a request for a
book to read, website or other material to help the client explore their topic in more
depth. It may be feedback from the client, behaviors to continue doing or things to
change for the next session. It might also include referrals or actions that the coach
needs to implement, such as contacting the organization, sponsor or connecting the
client with someone else in their network, such as referral to a therapist or to another
coach. If the coach does not write it down its easier to forget and let these
requests slip.
What Notes Should We Make After a Session?
This depends on your personal style. We suggest elsewhere in this book the use of a
personal learning journal. The coach may use this to write reﬂections at the end of
each session or the end of each week. We believe that reﬂection is an important
component in the coach’s developmental journey and that a journal can be a very
useful aid, noting down after each session thoughts, feelings and insights.
If the coach is able to gather information from each session, this provides several
beneﬁts. Firstly, it’s a source of material for the coach to take to supervision. What
patterns do they observe over weeks or months or with speciﬁc clients or type of
clients? Secondly, it provides an opportunity to think through issues while writing.
Finally, for many people the act of writing is a cathartic process allowing them to let
go of the feelings, or thoughts, which are provoked during a session or a day of
coaching, allowing them to move on to the next part of their day, leaving these
feelings behind.
The journal may be short or long, running to 100 words or 1000, depending on
your style and the issues the session or week provokes.
We have described in detail elsewhere in this book one tool for this reﬂection,
known as the Henley8. The Henley8 is a series of questions that provide a useful
framework to guide the reﬂective process.
What Notes Should We Make After a Session?
191

This is your action plan to consider for the future.
What Should You Do If Your Client or Sponsor Asks
for Your Notes?
This issue is best managed before it arises through the contract with the organization,
sponsor and the individual client.
As a general rule, using tripartite contracting can reduce the risk of a sponsor
asking for a feedback report. Tripartite contracting involves the coach holding a
pre-coaching meeting with the individual client, line manager or sponsor to discuss
the nature of coaching and the expectations of each party. The coach documents the
coaching priorities from each party that is used throughput the assignment to guide
the coaching. At the end of the coaching assignment a second meeting is held to
review the coaching program. The coach facilitates this conversation, ensuring both
the views of the sponsor/line manager and the individual client are heard, while not
expressing a personal opinion or judgment. In some cases, a mid-point review
meeting can also be useful. This might happen after say the fourth or sixth sessions
in an 8 or 12 session assignment, to check in with both parties for their views on
progress and to realign priorities if needed.
192
25
Taking and Managing Coaching Notes

With a tripartite meeting in place most sponsors don’t ask the coach for a report or
their notes. If this does happen, we would refer back to the initial meeting saying the
details inside the session are conﬁdential.
It is useful to keep in mind any legislative requirements for disclosure of notes. In
many parts of the world, such as the European Union, individuals have a right to
view any personal data held about them by an individual or organization, such as a
coach (Passmore and Rogers, 2018). This would include any notes, ﬁles, or records
with the individual’s name, address, or other personal details. It is worth noting that
even if the coach is not based in the EU, coaching someone based in that region via
the internet or a conference call will also be covered by the legislation.
Given coaching’s spread across the world and the increasing use of the internet
and conference call coaching, rules will vary across the globe, so bear this in mind
when you are coaching.
The ﬁnal issue to consider in the requirement to disclosure notes to the police
or civil authorities. Again, legislation varies widely. Notes may be required for
employment law cases where the organisation (employer) or employee is taking
legal action. In most instances the release of such notes needs to be ordered by a
Judge as opposed to be requested by the police. It is best to understand how the law
operates in your part of the world (Turner and Passmore, 2017). Comments regard-
ing coaching related data can also be found in the ICF Code of Ethics.
Managing and Secure Deletion of Client Data
Once we have collected notes, we need to think about how we will store, manage and
destroy these notes at the appropriate time. GDPR (European Union General Data
Protection Regulations) requires you to establish a policy for the management,
storage and destruction of personal data. This relates to both written and digital data.
In terms of management of notebooks think about what information you keep in
them. You might for example only use initials on your notes. At home you might
keep the ﬁles and notebooks in a locked ofﬁce or a locked ﬁling cabinet. For digital
data ensure your computer is password protected and you use anti-virus software that
is regularly updated.
The policy should also make clear when and how you will delete your data. We
would suggest approximately 2–3 years after completing the coaching relationship is
appropriate. You can make this an annual task to review your ﬁles and delete records
that are more than 2 or 3 years old. For paper ﬁles this requires the use of a shredder.
For digital ﬁles this requires deletion and emptying the Trash folder on your device.
It will also need appropriately disposing of computers and hard drives which contain
data to prevent someone accessing the data on your device after you have disposed
of it.
Managing and Secure Deletion of Client Data
193

Conclusion
In this chapter we have explored brieﬂy the issue of note taking. We have suggested
that while it can be useful to take brief notes, coaches are best to spend more time and
energy being fully present, rather than taking notes. When they do take notes
coaches might use the PIPS model as a guide to note taking focusing on Personal
information, Ideas which arise in the session, client Plans and future Suggestions.
We also discussed the need to be respectful to clients in our use of language, and to
bear in mind in many countries clients will have the right to ask to see our notes.
Finally, we have talked about the importance of having styles to store and destroy
notes at the need of a reasonable period.

Chapter 26
Maintaining Presence Through Mindfulness
Introduction
A common challenge for many coaches is remaining present during a coaching
session. We can often be distracted by events that have taken place before the
session, as we think about the previous coaching session, by events during the
coaching sessions, as our mind wanders on from what the client has been saying,
or as our mind moves on to think about the next session or client. In this chapter we
consider one way which coaches can enhance their presence in a session through the
development of mindfulness practice.
Maintaining Presence
In Chap. 10 we reviewed the ICF’s Competence Maintains Presence, speciﬁcally
remaining conscious and present with the client, while employing a style that is
open, ﬂexible, grounded and conﬁdent. In Chap. 7 we also reviewed ICF Core
Competency 2: Embodies a Coaching Mindset which positions the need for the
coach to draw upon their own self-awareness; develop the ability to regulate their
own emotions and be mentally and emotionally prepared for coaching sessions.
These practices and qualities help to underpin our capacity to Maintain Presence
with our clients and we will look at them further in this chapter.
One approach that we have found helpful in our own practice of establishing a
coaching mindset and being present is mindfulness. Mindfulness has become a
popular concept, with growing evidence about its positive beneﬁts for health and
performance. However, mindfulness is also a useful coaching tool, that coaches can
use themselves, helping them to be fully present in the moment and being
non-judgmental of themselves and clients.

What Is Mindfulness?
The term mindfulness is derived from a translation of the Buddhist term sati. Sati
combines aspects of awareness, attention and remembering, which are conducted
with non-judgment, acceptance, kindness and friendliness to oneself and others.
A number of writers have offered deﬁnitions of mindfulness over the 2500 years
of its history from its Buddhist roots. In the twenty-ﬁrst century, one of the best-
known writers on the subject, Jon Kabat-Zinn, suggests it is a way of paying
attention, on purpose, in the present moment, non-judgmentally. For those who
prefer a more formal deﬁnition: “Mindfulness is simply a practical way to be
more in touch with the fullness of your being through a systematic process of self-
observation, self-inquiry and mindful action. There is nothing cold, analytical or
unfeeling about it. The overall tenor of mindfulness practice is gentle, appreciative,
and nurturing.” (Kabat-Zinn, 1991, p13).
The Beneﬁts of Mindfulness
Over the past three decades, research has revealed that mindfulness offers signiﬁcant
beneﬁts to practitioners. These ﬁndings have been revealed as a resulted of an
explosion of published papers examining mindfulness in both health settings, as
well as the workplace (Passmore, 2019a, b).
Research has shown that mindfulness has beneﬁts that can be applied across a
range of scenarios, from mental health and depression to cancer care, heart disease,
pain management and reduction in blood pressure. Possibly less discussed, however,
are the cognitive beneﬁts that mindfulness practice confers. Research in this area has
shown positive effects on general brain performance, including working memory
and attention, control and brain efﬁciency (Neubauer and Fink, 2009; Ocasio, 2011;
Smallwood and Schooler, 2015). It is in these areas that the regular practice of
mindfulness can help coaches.
How Can Mindfulness Help in Coaching?
We can think about this in three elements: ﬁrstly, the coach, secondly the client and
thirdly the relationship. Effective coaching requires the coach to offer to each client
their full focused attention. This is not always easy when our personal and profes-
sional lives have blurred boundaries and the pressures of the two merge into a mix of
worries and confusion. Mindfulness provides an answer; it focuses our attention to
the only moment that is here and now.
Clients too are likely to be caught in their own vortex of pressures and anxieties.
Like the coach, they too carry unhelpful baggage from one event to the next, letting
196
26
Maintaining Presence Through Mindfulness

feelings and thoughts project from one event or relationship, to the next. Mindful-
ness can provide them the opportunity to focus their attention to the session and to
their learning too.
As both the coach and the client carry with them past events and relationship, as
well as fears and thoughts about the future, the coaching relationship too can suffer.
Writers like Carl Roger’s and Fritz Perl, who we have discussed earlier recognized
the importance of the relationship in one to one work.
As we noted, central to Carl Roger’s humanistic approach were the concepts of
Congruence and Empathic understanding (Rogers, 1961). Congruence is the way for
the coach to be true to themselves. Rogers suggests that during this state the feelings
the coach is experiencing are available to them, and they are able to live these
feelings, and communicate them as appropriate. Through congruence the coach is
best placed to facilitate awareness, providing curious inquiry and helping clients
identify insight.
Empathy can be described as the ability to “put oneself into somebody else’s
shoes.” This implies that a person who is empathic is able to “step out” of their own
reality and into their client’s. Mindfulness can help us with this process too, helping
us to work with strong client emotions without becoming lost in these emotions.
Being empathic creates a support structure necessary for the client to feel the coach’s
presence, their support and their understanding. While allowing the coach to be
aware of the emotions they are experiencing and being able to contain these
emotions, helping the client to work with them to achieve insight and move forward.
Similarly, the work of Fritz Perl is centered on the empathic, moment-by-moment
exploration of the issues raised by the client. Key ideas are presence and working
between the here and now and the next. Presence, in Gestalt, refers to the ability to
focus attention on the client so to respond as authentically as possible to their needs.
The “Here and Now,” and “Next” refer to the exploration of the present, helping the
client integrate this learning for future action. We have explored Gestalt in detail in
Chap. 18.
From our exploration of mindfulness, we believe there are four main ways
mindfulness can be useful to coaching practice.
Box 26.1 Potential beneﬁts of mindfulness in coaching

Helping the coach to prepare for coaching
•
Helping the coach maintain focus in a session

Available as a tool to share with clients
Developing Presence Before a Session
One challenge most coaches face is the challenge of the wandering mind. The coach
may be moving from one client’s premises to another, or from one conference call
to the next. In these situations, the wandering mind can lead to the mind gravitating
Developing Presence Before a Session
197

back to the previous call or drifting off to consider the next issue. Mindfulness
offers a practical way of putting such demands aside and focusing on the here
and now.
One way to achieve this is by the coach incorporating this tool into their practice.
Allowing 4 min for a brief body scan before each session. Getting in the right metal
space, just like an athlete before their next race, is important. A wide variety of body
scans is available on the web and these can be downloaded as a digital ﬁle to play on
a phone. Alternatively, we have included a guided body scan in Table 26.1.
Maintain Presence During the Session
Mindfulness can also be useful for the coach in helping maintain presence in an
individual session. With coaching sessions of an hour to two, the wandering mind
can draw the coach away from full attention.
Being aware of this risk, can help coaches to better manage it. This requires the
coach to be attentive to what is happening to them in the present moment. Should
they ﬁnd themselves being distracted, for example by noise from the street or
thoughts about past or future sessions or other distractions, the coach can catch
these thoughts and redirect their attention back to the client. Only when the coach is
fully present can they act in service of the client with curiosity and emotional
empathy. When out of step, the client risks missing both verbal content and meaning,
and thus making the session about themselves not being in service of their client.
You can read more on maintaining presence in Chap. 10.
Table 26.1 The lobby/waiting room body scan
Step 1
Find somewhere comfortable to sit and create a posture of erectness and dignity.
Step 2
Start to observe the breath; the in-breath and the outbreath. Follow this for eight or nine
cycles of slowly breathing in and out; ﬁlling the lungs and slowing exhaling, before
starting the cycle again.
Step 3
Start to be aware of what’s going on in the body: any pains, tensions, or sensations. Be
open to these sensations, not judging them or seeking to explain them, but simply being
aware of their existence.
Step 4
Direct the breath to any areas of tension or stress, and allow the breath to hold, caress,
and surround any uncomfortable sensations, allowing these sensations to dissolve or
subside. Taking each place of tension or stress in turn, and directing eight or nine
breathes into each place, or as many as feels appropriate, until each subdues.
Step 5
Start to broaden the breath and become aware of the sensation of the whole body as you
close the mindful body scan, sitting erect and digniﬁed in the chair.
Step 6
Take that closing sensation into the next part of the day.
198
26
Maintaining Presence Through Mindfulness

Managing Emotions During the Session
A third challenge faced by the coach is the relationship, speciﬁcally managing the
emotional content created from a personal and intimate conversation. While super-
vision and peer mentoring can be helpful tools, depending on the topics that the
coach works with, mindfulness can also be a useful tool, helping clients in the
moment.
Coaching can create strong feelings of attraction or revulsion toward the client, or
their behavior. This leads to a risk of collusion, where the coach becomes an ally of
the client, against the ‘big bad organization’, or other stakeholders who are not
present. It can also lead to physical attractions either from the client toward the
coach, or vice-versa.
Mindfulness provides a resource enabling the coach to be more aware of them-
selves, their natural human emotional responses, and with this awareness, better able
to manage their responses appropriately.
The coach’s ability to manage their emotions is also explored in Chap. 7.
Techniques to Develop Presence
There are a wide number of mindfulness techniques which when practice regularly
in coaching sessions or during other tasks, and which can contribute to improving
our longer-term presence within sessions (Passmore and Amit, 2017) (Table 26.2).
Table 26.2 Three practices for mindfulness
Awareness of environmen-
tal distractions
This exercise is about being aware of what is happening around us:
A buzzing insect, noise in the street or the tap, tap, tap of the
client’s pen. Being aware of, accepting these as these as neither
good or bad, simple as noises in our environments, and returning
our focus to the client.
STOP
This exercise is a suggestion to help us become more proactive by
stopping and choosing mindfully how we want to continue with
our day. It’s something we can do that does not require much time.
Being the observer
Rumination is a common human trait. It can happen especially
when the client is upset about something that has happened or a
conversation that did not go as they wished or planned. The client
may over-identify with their thinking leading them to become
anxious, stressed or upset. In these circumstances the coach can
simple notice their client’s response, remind themselves they are
not their thoughts, and these thoughts are not the truth, but a
perception. In this way the coach can avoid being drawn into the
emotional turmoil which the client can be experiencing.

Conclusion
Maintaining presence is an important task within coaching. Mindfulness practice can
be a useful tool that coaches can use that can help them prepare for each session. The
tool is both useful in the present moment, but through regular practice also
strengthens the coach’s focus over time.

Maintaining Presence Through Mindfulness

Developing Your Practice
Introduction
This part is a series of chapters which offer a variety of ways for coaches to embrace
the idea of lifelong learning and development. As highlighted in Chap. 1 at the very
beginning of this book, by engaging in the process of becoming a coach, there is an
embedded philosophy and value of a long-term commitment to our own growth,
self-awareness and maturity over time. We begin Chap. 27 by looking at Continuous
Professional Development (CPD). We continue in Chap. 28 by exploring one way to
bring this into our practice through personal development plans (PDP’s). We outline
many reasons why your ongoing professional development is not only important but
is also of great beneﬁt to you in many aspects of how you position yourselves in a
growing market sector. We provide you with the ICF’s perspectives and expecta-
tions of ICF credentialed coaches regarding their professional development along
with an overview of the development process for credential renewal.
Chapter 29 introduces coaching supervision as a very useful and powerful form of
ongoing professional development for coaches. We deﬁne what is supervision
within the context of coaching and share a simple model of supervision which
describes the function and scope of this valuable activity. We also cover how
supervision works in practice as well as several examples of how it can beneﬁt the
coach on both a personal and professional level. Finally, we offer some hints and tips
for helping you ﬁnd a suitable supervisor and some thoughts on how to get the very
best out of this kind of development practice.
We continue with an exploration of reﬂective practice in Chap. 30. We begin by
describing what reﬂective practice is and its beneﬁts for the coach and their coaching
practice. We also offer and describe different tools and approaches for you to engage
in reﬂection.
Chapters 31 and 32 explore two aspects of the ICF’s credentialing and ongoing
development process: mentor coaching and the coach knowledge assessment
(CKA). In Chap. 31 we describe and deﬁne mentor coaching, speciﬁcally from a
coaching credentialing perspective and how this differs from other deﬁnitions of

mentoring. We give an overview of when and how mentor coaching is relevant and
required by ICF for credentialing and credential renewal. Mentor coaching can be
addressed in several ways; however, we share the key principles and approaches of
how it tends to work in practice and also offer guidance on ﬁnding a suitable mentor
coach and how to get the very best out of this really valuable development process.
Continuing with Chap. 32, the CKA is described, including what it is as well as
what its purpose and place is in the ICF credential application process. We share
some examples of questions from the CKA and some guidance on how to prepare for
this knowledge assessment exercise.
We bring this part to a close with Chap. 33 which explores how you can continue
to develop your coaching skills over time. The concepts of coach maturity and
lifelong learning return and, in this chapter, we offer guidance on how a coach can
continue their development within the ICF credentialing system. We look at what is
PCC and what is needed to achieve that next level of credential along with some of
the key differences between ACC and PCC level coaching. We also share aspects of
coaching that differentiate PCC and MCC level and offer a model of professional
development which describes the transition from science to art in terms of how we
continue to develop and grow in our coaching practice.

Chapter 27
Personal Development Plans
Introduction
In this chapter we focus on Personal Development Plans (PDP). PDPs are an
important aspect of developing our coaching practice and we begin by sharing
what is understood by the term personal development plan along with the purpose
and beneﬁts of this as an ongoing process. We also look at some of the underlying
theory in support of PDPs and the practicalities of creating them. Finally, we suggest
that personal and professional development for coaches are intertwined and as such,
recommend reading Chaps. 27 and 28 as a combined exercise.
What Is a Personal Development Plan?
The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) deﬁnes personal
development planning as a “structured and supported process undertaken by an
individual to reﬂect upon their own learning, performance and/or achievement and
to plan for their personal, educational and career development.”
The QAA go on to state that the primary purpose of PDP is to “improve the
capacity of individuals to review, plan and take responsibility for their own learning
and to understand what and how they learn. PDP helps learners articulate their
learning, achievements and outcomes more explicitly and supports the concept
that learning is a life-long and life-wide activity.”
As coaches, our personal and professional development may be intertwined, and
this chapter seeks to link closely with Chap. 28: Continuous Professional Develop-
ment which outlines the International Coaching Federation’s (ICF) stance and
expectations of coaches regarding their ongoing professional growth. A clear com-
mitment to our ongoing learning and development as a coach and our engagement in

reﬂective practice are speciﬁcally noted within the ICF Core Competency Model in
Competency 2: Embodies a Coaching Mindset which is covered in Chap. 7.
We propose that our approach to our PDP embraces the following principles in
that it is:
•
Structured and proactively planned with intentionality and a commitment to being
a life-long learner
•
Holistic in scope, covering academic, personal and professional development
activities
•
A process with which we feel supported and guided in some way (e.g. from a
teacher, mentor coach or supervisor) and which also encourages and enables self-
sufﬁciency and a self-sustaining pattern over time
•
An ongoing process involving goal setting, action planning, self-reﬂection and
monitoring toward the achievement of those goals
•
A process that enables us to share and demonstrate our incremental learning to
others (e.g. with our clients, during learning events and in coaching assessment
activities such as credential applications and renewals).
The process of PDP can be linked to learning theory and in particular to the four-
stage cycle of effective learning based on the work of Kolb (Fig. 27.1).

Personal Development Plans

How Can a Personal Development Plan Help Me?
The beneﬁts of a PDP are in many ways similar to those of continuous professional
development (CPD). In particular, regular and sustained PDP activities help us to:
•
Recognize, value, acknowledge and evidence our learning and development in
formal and informal ways
•
Take ownership for our growth
•
Become more aware of how we learn and what different learning strategies work
well/less well for us, thereby expanding our own self-awareness on what is
effective for us as learners and practitioners
•
Be more effective in planning, monitoring and reviewing our own progress
•
Develop our sense of identity as a learner and as a continuously developing coach
•
Identify and evaluate our strengths and development opportunities and make
plans for enhancing the strengths and addressing our development needs
•
Be better prepared as coaches, for individual sessions, overall engagements and
as a professional coach more broadly
•
Be able to maintain our offering to be aligned with current practices and expec-
tations so that we can continue to thrive in our practice
In order for these many beneﬁts to be realized, the following characteristics
underpin the most effective personal development plans:
•
Our PDP is a mainstream activity that actively and overtly features in our yearly
calendar planning
•
Development activities are directly linked to development goals that we have set
for ourselves
•
PDP activities are undertaken regularly and are valued by the coach
•
The coach feels supported and encouraged in their learning process
•
The PDP activities are recorded and reviewed to establish and acknowledge
progress
What Should I Include in My PDP?
When creating your own Personal Development Plan, it is important to make sure it
accurately outlines your personal goals, why they’re important to you, and how you
plan to achieve them. To support the creation of your development goals, you might
like to apply the mnemonic/acronym of S.M.A.R.T (Speciﬁc, Measurable, Achiev-
able, Relevant and Time-bound) which can help in fully considering and describing
what you will do, when and how, etc.
Although all PDPs are speciﬁc to each coach, the plan will generally describe
your ideal future based on your short, medium and/or long-term ambitions. Areas of
development will be speciﬁc to you, and could be centered on further education,
coaching practice or personal growth.
What Should I Include in My PDP?
205

It is also recommended that you consider the potential obstacles you might face,
and how you propose to overcome them—and if the barriers can’t be tackled, include
a contingency plan to help your development as a coach keep moving forward.
There are many ways to capture and track our development activities and here is a
simple template to illustrate how we might do this (Table 27.1).
When Should I Start My PDP?
You can start your PDP at any point; in fact, we would propose the sooner the better.
It may be that your attendance at your ﬁrst coach-speciﬁc training marked the
beginning of a new personal and professional journey for you; however, it may
also be that your development up to that point was part of a plan that had you
heading in the direction of coaching. Either way, it is never too early to start this
important and valuable process.

Personal Development Plans

In addition, a proactive approach and an attitude of intentionality when it comes
to our ongoing development as coaches is something that is much valued and even
expected within our profession. At the end of the day, we are the tool for our work
and, regardless of where we are in our development journey, we can always continue
to learn and grow so that we can be the very best version of ourselves, for ourselves
and for our clients.
Conclusion
In this chapter we have introduced the concept of personal development planning as
a way to develop your coaching practice. We have deﬁned and described what is
meant by PDP, with its associated beneﬁts and practical ways to create a plan that
works for you. In the following chapter, we continue with the theme of development,
this time exploring professional development and propose that both of these aspects
of development are core to the growth of a coach and their effective coaching
practice.

Chapter 28
Continuing Professional Development
Introduction
Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is an important aspect of professional
coaching and is integral to the embodiment of a coaching mindset. This chapter
looks at how CPD is deﬁned as well as the many beneﬁts it offers to coaches, not just
in terms of their professional growth and development, but also its positive impact
on the development of their coaching business and practice as a whole. We also
outline the International Coaching Federation’s (ICF) stance and requirements
regarding CPD for coaches to maintain and renew their ICF Credential.
What Is Continuing Professional Development?
Continuing Professional Development is deﬁned by The CPD Certiﬁcation Service
as the “holistic commitment of professionals toward the enhancement of personal
skills and proﬁciency throughout their careers” (CPD, 2020). This commitment
usually includes learning to gain and maintain professional credentials through
academic degrees or professionally accredited courses of study. It also embraces
informal learning and practice opportunities and usually involves some kind of
periodic evaluation. What is also noteworthy is the term “throughout their careers,”
emphasizing the continuity of development over time.
From an International Coaching Federation (ICF) perspective, the coach pro-
gresses toward and earns their professional credential (ACC, PCC or MCC). The
ICF’s position on CPD states that: “as part of a self-regulating industry, ICF is
committed to coaches providing consistent value to their clients. In order to maintain
these professional standards, ICF’s position on CPD keeps pace with industry
expectations and emerging standards” (ICF, 2020b) The concept of being a life-
long learner is also one which is commonplace amongst the coaching community

209

and this is actively supported and expected via the process of the periodic renewal of
an ICF Credential every 3 years, which was referenced in Chap. 5.
The Beneﬁts of Continuing Professional Development
The beneﬁts of continuing professional are many and varied. Apart from enabling us
to meet the expectations of professional credentialing bodies and the demands of the
coaching marketplace, CPD also offers us rich opportunities for variety, interest and
growth.
Reasons for investing in your continuing professional development include:
•
Renewing credentials—as already noted, an ICF credential expires after 3 years
and the coach is required to demonstrate they have completed at least 40 h of CPD
during that period.
•
Enhancing your offering—as coaching becomes more widespread, the market-
place is also becoming more competitive. Investing in your own CPD will enable
you to enhance the depth and breadth of your offering, enabling you to more
clearly articulate your unique selling points and skills, and what your clients can
expect when they hire you as their coach.
•
Staying ﬁt for practice—linked to the point above, not only does CPD enhance
our skillset and professional offering, it also helps us to avoid stagnation. As with
any profession and indeed any activity, if we stop learning and developing after
our initial qualiﬁcation is secured, it can be very easy to slip into bad habits,
become complacent, and even begin to cut corners.
•
Credibility and reputation—the marketplace of coaching, especially within orga-
nizations is now increasingly aware of what coaching is and organizations are
much more informed about coaching when making their buying decisions. This is
part of the increasing competition and therefore differentiation between good and
not so good coaches that is characteristic of a self-regulating industry. Coaching
is also a profession that in many cases still relies heavily on referrals and so our
credibility and reputation within the community of coaches and the buyers of
coaching is important for our ongoing employment.
•
More client work—as a result of the above points, actively and proactively
investing in our CPD plan of activities is going to help us to secure more client
work and coaching engagements. Moreover, in many organizations, professional
credentials are being set as a requirement for eligibility to work as part of their
coaching community. Coaching Supervision, which is explored in Chap. 29, is a
very useful form of CPD and is also something that informed organizations are
increasingly expecting of coaches as a prerequisite for client engagements.
•
Sharpening your saw—we previously noted the concept of “life-long learner” and
one of the more personal beneﬁts of CPD can be found if we adopt a mindset that
coaching is a craft and that we take pride over the course of our careers to
continuously sharpen our own saw so that our craft is the very best it can be.
210
28
Continuing Professional Development

•
Community—Whilst coaches are working with people all the time, their profes-
sional relationships and connections often have a transitory nature. In this way,
coaches can also be alone in their work and, in some cases coaches can even feel a
degree of isolation. CPD therefore offers a great opportunity to be part of a
community, to experience a sense of belonging and to engage in stimulating
conversations and experiences with other professional colleagues. These
coaching communities not only service to offer connection, they can also be
useful places for networking which could lead to other client opportunities.
•
Growth vs. ﬁxed mindset—Carol Dweck in her book, Mindset (2017), describes
the many beneﬁts of encouraging our brains to develop a love for learning as a
basis for accomplishment. This also links to the Four Stages of Competence and
how, even though we may aspire to the beneﬁts of reaching “unconscious
competence” when our craft becomes second nature, there is also a danger of
complacency and stagnation that might lead to us having become “unconsciously
incompetent” once more without realizing it. CPD helps us to avoid this through
staying conscious about our learning and development.
What Are CCE’s?
The ICF’s requirement of a minimum of 40 h of CPD every 3 years is acquired
through engaging in development activities which lead to the coach accumulating
Continuing Coach Education (CCE) units toward their credential renewal. Typically,
1 h of CPD equates to one CCE unit and these units can be earned in various ways.
The CCEs are also split into two different types: Core Competency (CC) CCEs and
Resource Development (RD) CCEs. For a credential renewal, the coach must
complete at least 24 CCEs that are categorized as Core Competency (CC), at least
3 h of which are in coaching ethics. The remaining 16 h can be in Resource
Development (RD) CCEs (see Table 28.1).
One very easy way to earn these units is through participating in events that have
received an ofﬁcial CCE accreditation from the ICF. Coach training schools and
training providers can apply to the ICF to gain CCE accreditation for the CPD events
they offer. In addition, ICF local chapters around the world, as well as the ICF
Professional Coaches Global organization, offer CPD activities with CCEs and these
are often offered either free of charge or at a reduced rate for members of the ICF.
Examples of events and activities that can offer CCEs include webinars, communi-
ties of practice (COP), training programs, conferences, mentor coaching, supervision
and special ICF approved projects. More details of eligible sources of CCEs can be
found on the ICF Global website. The ICF Professional Coaches Global organization
also holds a global events calendar where events, both in person and virtual, all over
the world are advertised, many of which carry CCEs. Local ICF Chapters often also
advertise local events via their websites. The ICF Global organization also has a

211

learning portal where members can access a wide range of learning and development
opportunities.
In Chap. 29 on Supervision, we note that up to 10 h of supervision can be counted
toward a coach’s 40 h of CC CCEs every 3 years. In addition, in Chap. 31 we explore
Mentor Coaching and coaches can work with a Mentor Coach and allocate up to 10 h
of CC CCEs every 3 years toward their credential renewal. This is a requirement for
those seeking to renew their ACC credential and optional for coaches renewing their
PCC or MCC credentials.
Apart from these examples of ICF approved CCE sources, there are other
non-approved
activities
that
can
be
counted
as

Development
(RD) CCEs. Up to a maximum of 16 h of this kind of development can be allocated
toward the 40-h required every 3 years. Examples of these activities include non-
coach-speciﬁc training, reading, writing and research. Once again, details of eligible
activities can be found on the ICF Global website (see: https://coachfederation.org).
Professional or Personal Development?
The concept of Professional Development is one that is probably very familiar to
us. We may apply this to ourselves, and also our work as coaches may be in direct
relation to the professional development of our clients. Having explored what
professional development is, its beneﬁts and how we can engage in it, now let’s
look at this idea of professional development within the context of today’s
environment.
Terms like “digital revolution,” “4th industrial revolution,” and “VUCA” (vola-
tile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) have entered daily business language.
Alongside this, we may ﬁnd ourselves immersed in conversations around climate
change, economic and political turbulence, mental health and matters of social
progress. In light of the characteristics and challenges this type of environment

present, the World Economic Forum has shared that the following Top 10 skills will
be most needed from leaders in 2020 and beyond:
1. Complex problem solving
2. Critical Thinking
3. Creativity
4. People Management
5. Coordinating with Others
6. Emotional Intelligence
7. Judgment and decision-making
8. Service Orientation
9. Negotiation
10. Cognitive Flexibility
One of the things we think really stands out is that most, if not all, of these skills
are as closely related to our personal development as they are to our professional
development. By way of an example, we are struck by the distinct shift we see in the
focus of our children’s’ education, which is now centered around equipping them
with skills of the type noted above, as opposed to the more traditional approach of
helping them develop subject matter expertise. We see the same concept applying to
leaders in the workplace. One head teacher recently described their philosophy as
“future-prooﬁng” leaders and we propose that in fact the leaders we may be working
with today even need “present-prooﬁng,” because the future is truly here.
At the ICF Converge19 event in Prague, one of the keynote speakers, Frans
Johansson (2019) said: “Today is the slowest day you will ever experience from now
on”. Looking at the skills above, the ability to handle change and change at speed are
crucial and these skills offer a foundation for that to be possible.
So, the ﬁrst question that comes to mind, is how can we as coaches support these
leaders to be most effective in developing these skills? A second question follows
closely and that is: how can we as coaches develop these skills and qualities so that
we remain useful, relevant and ﬁt for practice in our fast-changing world? Given that
the business of coaching has change, growth and development at is heart, how can
we ensure that we too are role modelling the ability to change and grow alongside
our clients?
One thing that comes to mind is that we consider the concept of “ﬁrst look
within”. What is the personal development opportunity for us as coaches? For
example, how are you with change? How are you with uncertainty and ambiguity?
How are you with goal posts changing regularly and rapidly? How are you with the
balance between perceiving something as an opportunity or a threat? Do you have
the skills noted above? By ﬁrst looking within, the ripple effect of coaching actually
starts with us. . .and perhaps this is one of the ways that we can make our biggest
contribution.
Professional or Personal Development?

Conclusion
In this chapter we have described Continuous Professional Development (CPD) and
how it is deﬁned and positioned by the International Coaching Federation. We have
also outlined several reasons why our CPD is important and the signiﬁcant beneﬁts
to us by investing in this in an active and proactive way. We have described the
ICF’s CPD approach using CCE units and have shared examples of how to earn
these units for credential renewal and general development purposes. Finally, we
have also positioned the need for coaches to engage in personal as well as profes-
sional growth so that we can be the very best we can be in our coaching practice
across the whole of our coaching career.

Continuing Professional Development

Chapter 29
Supervision
Introduction
Supervision has become an important element within coach continuing professional
development, and while it’s not the only way for coaches to reﬂect on their practice,
the use of supervision as a mechanism is now widely accepted. Moreover, pur-
chasers of coaching services want to know that they are buying the best and knowing
that a coach is in supervision can be a great way of demonstrating quality assurance,
professionalism and integrity in one’s coaching practice. Indeed, in some commu-
nities, being in coaching supervision is now a prerequisite for being able to provide
coaching services within certain organizations. In this chapter we explore what is
supervision, the beneﬁts of supervision and how it can form part of a wider portfolio
of a coach’s professional development and reﬂective practice.
What Is Supervision?
The ICF deﬁnes supervision as: “a collaborative learning practice to continually
build the capacity of the coach through reﬂective dialogue for the beneﬁt of both
coaches and clients.”
Coaching Supervision focuses on the development of the coach’s capacity
through offering a richer and broader opportunity for support and development.
Coaching supervision creates a safe environment for the coach to share their
successes and failures in becoming masterful in the way they work with their clients.
Some writers prefer the term “super-vision” (Passmore and McGoldrick, 2009),
recognizing that the aim is not hierarchical, but a collaborative process designed to
enhance insight and understanding. When framing this as “super-vision” we describe
it as a process whereby the coach and the supervisor reﬂect together upon the coach’s
coaching practice and have over (super)-sight (vision), i.e. they are reﬂecting upon

215

the work to identify useful insights for ongoing learning and development. This
reﬂection promotes and enables enhanced professional practice by reviewing,
questioning, considering, thinking, and critically assessing our work as coaches.
This allows the coach to be the best they can be, which in turn maximizes the results
and impact for the client. Supervision is also an opportunity to think about the
broader impact and changes our insights will make to our continuing professional
practice as a coach as well as to acknowledge and celebrate success. Supervision is
an agreement between supervisor and supervisee that the highest function of the
process is to be in service of protection and of working in the best interest of the
client.
Supervision is a shared learning partnership between equals and the learning is
co-created and experiential. Therefore, by engaging in supervision, coaches are
making an important commitment that will support them, their clients, their spon-
sors, and wider society that is impacted by their work.
The Function and Scope of Supervision
Most coaching assignments require the coach to engage in challenging and intimate
conversations that take place within complex systems. While doing this, the coach is
managing the personal and professional boundaries, noticing the interpersonal
dynamics in the relationship between them and their client, managing themselves
in the moment, and being alert to the need for best practice and an ethically sound
stance. This can be quite a juggling act.
Time spent in supervision gives them some breathing space. It is an opportunity
to reﬂect on the things that affected them in a coaching exchange, other options that
might have been explored, things that left them puzzled, where they felt at their most
or least resourceful, and how their strengths and vulnerabilities might help and
hinder them.
Supervision is there to help reﬂect on these processes and its function and scope
can be seen as covering three main areas:
Learning and Development
In this domain, the focus is on the continuous growth and development of the coach
toward increasingly advanced competence. This aspect of the dialogue might focus
on the ICF Core Competencies as well as other related theories, models and concepts
that could be introduced into the discussion by either party. The focus is on the coach
as a coach and their ongoing skill development as a practitioner. Mentor Coaching
for Credentialing could be seen as sitting somewhere within this domain with
216
29
Supervision

regards to the speciﬁc focus on the ICF Core Competencies, however the roles of
Mentor Coach and Coach Supervisor are not always the same and the focus and
training for each discipline is different.
Support
Coaching Supervision also provides support for the coach in terms of them feeling
resourced, supported and nurtured. As such, the focus is on the person or the who of
the coach; the coach as a person. In this domain, topics such as conﬁdence, inner
dialogue, and helpful or limiting beliefs held by the coach might feature in the
discussion.
Safety and Standards
This domain is centered on quality and professionalism. Here, the dialogue may
reﬂect upon how the coach is managing their overall coaching practice, ethical
considerations and the safety of the coach and their client, as well as having
consideration for the system within which the coaching work is being undertaken.
Here, the ICF’s gold standard and the core values of excellence, integrity, collabo-
ration and respect are at the forefront of the reﬂective dialogue and the focus is on the
coach as a professional.
Within the context of these three areas, coaching supervision is sometimes
described as working with “where the personal intrudes on the professional” in
that the focus is on ensuring that the coach does not get in the way of their client’s
learning and development but is instead an enabling tool or vehicle for their client.
This triangulated approach to supervision has been articulated and evolved in the
last 25 or so years and many models of supervision have been imported into
coaching from the ﬁelds of therapy, counseling and management (Kadushin, 1976;
Proctor, 2000; Hawkins & Smith, 2006; Newton & Napper, 2007) (Figs. 29.1 and
29.2).
How Does Supervision Work in Practice?
In practical terms, coaching supervision bears some resemblance to coaching in that
the coach and supervisor need to establish that there is chemistry and rapport for
them to work effectively together. They will contract with each other around how
they will work, and similar boundaries of conﬁdentiality are upheld. The focus of

each supervision session will be clearly established and may be related to the above
domains in the context of, for example:
•
Case analysis (i.e., the coach’s work with a particular client or a particular session
with a client).
•
Patterns and themes that the coach is noticing about their coaching practice across
their client base.
•
Observations that the coach is having about themselves within the context of their
coaching practice.
•
Review of the ICF Core Competencies or other coaching-related materials and
how they are being evidenced in the coach’s practice.
•
Exploration of the “who” of the coach.

Supervision

Sometimes, it can be helpful to frame the supervision topic as a question which
the coach and supervisor then work collectively to answer. Some examples of
supervision questions might be:
•
I have a lot going on personally at the moment, how can I be sure that I am fully
present for my clients?
•
My client has told me they are being bullied; what are my responsibilities as a
coach and how can I be of best service to them?
•
I ﬁnd myself getting very distracted and even impatient when coaching client A;
what can I learn that will help me be the best coach I can be for them?
•
I am usually conﬁdent as a coach, however when coaching Client B, I ﬁnd myself
feeling intimidated and trying to impress them; what is it that is triggering this
response in me?
•
I get so engaged in coaching my clients that I lose track of time and our sessions
seem to end abruptly with no clear actions or forward movement; how can I
manage the time better for a better ending to the session?
•
My client shared something that really goes against my values and I’m ﬁnding it
difﬁcult to coach them without feeling negatively toward them; how can I
resolve this?
•
I have noticed that I am more verbose when coaching clients who are younger
than me; what is triggering this and what implications does this have for my
coaching with them?
These are just a few examples of the many, many questions that a coach might
bring into supervision and the common feature of all of them is that the conversation
is aimed at supporting the coach to be the best they can be in that situation and across
their coaching practice.
Coaching supervision can be undertaken on a 1–1 basis or as part of a supervision
group.
The one-to-one arrangement is in many ways similar to individual coaching: a
supervisor will be identiﬁed, perhaps based on recommendation and an exploratory
conversation, and a contract will be put in place covering the commercial, practical,
and ethical conditions for the work.
A group might be “closed” and made up of a speciﬁed number of regular
members who participate at each session. An ‘open’ group, by contrast, would
accommodate a potentially different mix of attendees each time, while still having
a limited number on each occasion. The contract for group work will acknowledge
these variations and differences.
There are other ways of bringing supervision into coaching practice, which are
perhaps best regarded as supplementary to or even by-products of the more formal
options outlined already.
Peer supervision is a process whereby coaches supervise each other, without any
one of them needing to have a supervisor’s qualiﬁcation. This can be a vibrant, cost-
effective and readily accessible option, making it possible for coaches to work
collaboratively one-to-one or in groups, offering mutual support, insights and shared
experience.
How Does Supervision Work in Practice?
219

For the purposes of meeting the supervision requirements of an organizational
client, or accreditation bodies, this would generally be seen as a useful supplement
to—not a substitute for—work with a qualiﬁed supervisor.
Finally, self-supervision—or the development of the internal supervisor—is an
asset that all coaches seek to nurture as an integral part of their growth and attention
to ethical practice. It is the capacity to bring a level of self-awareness and monitoring
of oneself as a coach into the moment when working with clients, grounded in a
habit of regular, private reﬂection. Self-supervision is a form of reﬂective practice
which is further described in Chap. 30. Once again, it is not a substitute for formal
supervision; however, here are some self-supervision questions which can offer a
structure to your reﬂective practice after a coaching session:
Box 29.1 A Tool for Self-Supervision
1. What went really well? (Reﬂect upon 2–3 areas of strength, using the
coaching competency framework I was trained in (e.g. ICF).
2. Which competencies really showed up in my coaching?
3. Which competencies were less evident, could have been evidenced more?
4. What else could I have done more or less of?
5. Were there any missed opportunities on my part?
6. Deepening my reﬂection—how do I notice this piece of work through the
lens of 1 or 2 models that I am familiar with? (e.g. PAC, Drama Triangle,
Life Positions, Hogan or other proﬁle, psychological distance, 7-eyed
model, cycles of change, cycles of learning, and others)
7. What are any ethical considerations within the piece of work?
8. How was my doing/being balance and my coaching presence with my
client—how was I being? Where was I personally in this piece of work?
9. What conscious bias do I notice or what unconscious bias might be
outside of my awareness?
10. What might have been the parallel process and what did that mean for
the work?
11. More generally in my coaching work, do I notice any patterns?
12. What are my own takeaways from my work? What am I learning about
myself as a person, as a coach, about my work?
13. What difference does that learning make? What and how will I integrate
this into my work?
How Can Supervision Help Me?
ICF does not currently require supervision and, in the past was skeptical about the
lack of evidence on coaching supervision, and whether supervision was a useful tool
for coaching reﬂective practice. However, over recent years, as further research is
undertaken, ICF has changed its position on supervision and is supportive of
220
29
Supervision

coaching supervision for full-time professional coach practitioners as part of their
portfolio of continuing professional development (CPD) activities designed to keep
them ﬁt for purpose.
To that end, ICF Credential holders may submit up to 10 h of Coaching Super-
vision as Core Competency credits toward their credential renewal.
Further the ICF recognizes that coaching supervision is different from coaching.
As a result, speciﬁc training is needed for supervisors to provide the knowledge and
opportunity to practice supervision skills. ICF also recognizes that supervision is
distinct from Mentor Coaching for an ICF Credential, which we will address in
Chap. 31.
Coaching supervision may include:
•
Exploring the coach’s internal process through reﬂective practice
•
Reviewing the coaching agreement and any other psychological or physical
contacts, both implicit and explicit
•
Uncovering blind spots—for example, beyond the one-to-one, coach-client rela-
tionship, the coach needs to stay mindful of the bigger picture—the broader
context of the client’s circumstances, as well as information and perspectives
that might be important yet outside of their awareness. This aspect is also
addressed in the ICF Core Competencies which describe the need for a coach
to hold an understanding of the client’s identity, environment, experiences, values
and beliefs.
•
Ethical issues
•
Ensuring the coach is “ﬁt for purpose” and perhaps offering accountability
•
Looking at all aspects of the coach and client’s environment for opportunities for
growth in the system
There are an increasing number of books and academic articles (see Tkach and
DiGirolamo, 2017; Bachkirova, Jackson, Hennig, & Moral, 2020) on the topic of
coaching supervision which identify the beneﬁts for coaches who receive supervi-
sion. The beneﬁts including:
•
Increased self-awareness
•
Greater conﬁdence
•
Increased objectivity
•
Heightened sense of belonging
•
Reduced feelings of isolation
•
Increased resourcefulness
In our own practice as supervisors and supervisees, we have also noticed and
heard reported the following beneﬁts:
•
Managing the quality, professionalism and integrity of the coaching work com-
pleted with clients
•
Due diligence and governance (through underpinning quality and also via the
thorough exploration and addressing of any relevant ethical issues or
considerations)

•
Coach continues to learn, develop and grow their skills through the reﬂective
practice of supervision
•
The organization underpins their return on investment in coaching and coaching
supervision through the continued professional development of the coach and the
subsequent beneﬁt of the coaching work they complete for their clients and the
organization at large
Coaching Supervisors
Coaching supervisors will usually be experienced coaches who have undergone
additional training to gain a qualiﬁcation in supervision skills. Many continue to
practice as coaches alongside their supervision work and will have supervisors of
their own.
Like coaches, supervisors will vary in their style, stance, and the approaches they
bring to their work. As with coaching, there are many models and frameworks
available in the ﬁeld of supervision (see Passmore, 2011). Some supervisors will
work with preferred approaches; others will adopt a more eclectic stance, drawing
from a range of thinking and sources.
This discipline requires speciﬁc training which will most likely cover at least one
or more ﬁelds of (coaching) psychology as well as speciﬁc supervision models. A
coaching supervisor is also most likely to be an experienced coach and also be self-
aware and mindful of their own part in the coach-supervisor dynamic and relation-
ship. For supervisors working with groups, an understanding of group dynamics and
group development is needed as well as knowledge of group supervision processes
and practices.
How Can I Find a Suitable Supervisor?
Choosing the right coaching supervisor or supervisors is in some ways similar to the
process that client might go through when selecting a coach. It is important that the
coach knows what they want from supervision, and what speciﬁc experience and
skills they would want their supervisor to demonstrate.
It can be helpful to consider a blend of one-to-one and group supervision, perhaps
with two or more supervisors who may be particularly well suited to different aspects
of their work, their needs, and the contexts in which they are coaching.
In Box 29.2 we have included seven key questions to keep in mind when
selecting a supervisor:
222

Supervision

Box 29.2 Questions to Ask Potential Supervisors
1. What are your qualiﬁcations, accreditations, and experience in coaching?
2. What are your qualiﬁcations, accreditations, and experience in coaching
supervision?
3. What experience do you have in the contexts in which I coach?
4. What experience do you have as a coach?
5. What are your own supervision arrangements for your work as a
supervisor?
6. What approach do you use in supervision?
7. Are you familiar with the ICF Code of Ethics and ICF practice?
Roles and Responsibilities
As has already been noted, it is important that the supervisor-coach relationship is
one that is contracted for, thus modelling professional coaching practice. Part of that
process will be to explore and clarify roles and responsibilities, which might include:
The Supervisor will be responsible for:
•
Time keeping
•
Managing the overall agenda of session
•
Monitoring ethical issues of coaching and supervision that may occur
•
Minimal note taking
•
Reporting any malpractice to the relevant governing body.
•
Co-creating a positive learning relationship, encompassing respect, encouraging
autonomy and enhancing the supervisory experience.
•
Ensuring a high level of professionalism in all interactions.
The Supervisee(s) will be responsible for:
•
Preparation for supervision—giving consideration to what is the “Supervision
Question”
•
Learning objectives.
•
Keeping notes for their own learning.
•
Letting the Supervisor know what is/isn’t working in the supervision partnership.
•
Ensuring they are in an appropriate location for their Supervision session.
•
Co-creating a positive learning relationship, encompassing respect, encouraging
autonomy and enhancing the supervisory experience.

223

Getting the Best from Supervision
Getting the best out of supervision is similar to getting the best out of coaching.
Planning and preparation play an important part in this and we recommend the
following as guidance for how you can engage in supervision and maximize your
learning and development experience:
•
Find a suitable supervisor(s): apart from the qualiﬁcations and experiences
aspects of a good supervisor, ensure that you have good chemistry with them.
Supervision is in intimate working space: you will share your pride, achievement
and success in a way that is hopefully fully and abundantly owned and celebrated.
You will also share your fears, concerns and vulnerabilities as a coach, as a
professional and as a person. Who is the right supervisor for you to do that with in
a safe, supportive and developmental environment?
•
Frequency: some supervisors have views on this and there are also no hard and
fast rules on how frequently a coach needs to be in supervision. Logic might
indicate that the more client work you have, the greater the need for
supervision. . .and supervision is also very useful to reﬂect upon just one single
coaching conversation. What is the right frequency for you, that will offer you
meaningful development and professional over-sight of your coaching practice
and be something that is achievable for you from a time and cost perspective?
•
Contract: with your supervisor so that you can quickly develop a strong working
connection and relationship.
•
Prepare: the process of reﬂective practice starts before the supervision session
takes place. This preparation could take on many forms according to your
preference, however considering some of the self-supervision questions previ-
ously noted will certainly help to generate thought.
•
Co-Create: work in partnership with your supervisor to co-create your working
relationship and how you engage with your supervision topics and questions.
•
Reﬂect (again!): after your supervision session, take some time to reﬂect once
again on what it is that you are noticing and learning about yourself and your
coaching practice and how will you integrate that learning for your ongoing
professional development?
Conclusion
In this chapter we have positioned coaching supervision as a powerful reﬂective
practice for professional development. We have explored deﬁnitions, function and
scope of supervision and what it means in practice to engage with this process.
Finally, we have also described some of the beneﬁts of working with a supervisor
and how to get the best out of your investment in this form of professional
development.

Chapter 30
Reﬂective Practice
Introduction
Learning to reﬂect in order to improve one’s own practice is seen as increasingly
important across a range of professions, from teaching to counseling, and from
management to clinical work. We have argued in Chap. 1 that knowing the self
and managing the self are key skills for every coach. The ICF competencies also
draw our attention to reﬂective practice, encouraging coaches to develop an ongoing
reﬂective practice. This self-awareness enables us to be in best service of our clients.
In this chapter we consider what is reﬂective practice, why it may be helpful, and
how we can incorporate this into our coaching practice.
What Is Reﬂective Practice?
The ICF competencies encourage coaches as part of the Coaching Mindset to
develop an ongoing reﬂective practice but do not offer a deﬁnition or description
of what is reﬂective practice and how one might go about this process. Some work
has been undertaken by members of the ICF team (Hullinger, DiGirilamo, & Tkach,
2019a, 2019b) who have reviewed the literature and offered a model for coaches and
clients.
Reﬂective practice may be deﬁned as the ability to reﬂect on one’s actions so as to
engage in a process of continuous learning. We believe reﬂective practice is the
foundation of all professional development. It enables the coach to transform
experience (coaching hours) into practical insights for personal growth and impact,
learning new ways of being and doing which can be applied in the coach. Without
reﬂection, collecting coaching hours can be just collecting stones; we may have a
whole pile of them, but they add little to who we are. Reﬂection allows us to carve
statues of insight and meaning from the rubble of coaching conversations.

Reﬂective practice involves integrating regular activities into our routine which
raises awareness, prompts critical analysis and aids self-management and decision-
making. It involves:
•
Learning to pay attention—listening to ourselves
•
Explore our assumptions
•
Observe patterns
We can assume learning is a discreet activity which is restricted to the coaching
classroom, where we listen and learn from a tutor or read a coaching book. But we
have the potential to learn all the time; from everything we do, every conversation
we have, every strand of information that comes our way. Reﬂective Practice is a
way of recognizing and articulating this learning, squeezing every insight from every
hour of coaching practice. However, to make best use of our coaching practice we
need to integrate reﬂective practice into our daily routine.
Why Reﬂective Practice Is Important
As a new coach it can be tempting to think at the end of the 65, 85, or 155 hour of
coach training, that you know everything you need to know about coaching—after
all you have completed the course. You can now get on with applying what you have
learnt. But the learning to coach might be compared with learning to drive. The
classroom sessions are no more than the driving lessons, and the ICF ACC, or PCC
assessment is the driving test. What we all know is that, during our ﬁrst few years on
the road, we really start to learn how to apply what we have learnt in the complexity
and chaos of sharing roads with other road users, in multiple weather conditions and
sometimes in different countries, where road signs have different meanings and even
which side of the road you drive changes. If we stopped learning in these situations
we could be in for a nasty accident. Good drivers, and good coaches, continue to
learn.
For the experienced PCC and MCC coach, maybe they have driven thousands of
hours and in multiple weathers, in multiple countries and over multiple terrains. But
we know that nothing stands still, if anything the pace of change is accelerating, and
new technologies are impacting on driving as they are on coaching. Experienced
coaches need to engage in reﬂective practice as much as new coaches.
In summary reﬂective practice encourages us to continue learning from our
coaching practice, and to hold ourselves as eternal students, or as we have suggested
elsewhere in the book, holding a ‘Beginner’s Mind’. This allows us to remain open,
curious, ﬂexible, and client-centered.
226

Reﬂective Practice

How To Develop Reﬂective Practice
Understanding what reﬂective practice is, and how to do it are two different things.
The ﬁrst step is to develop the skills needed for the reﬂective process. Only once
these skills have been identiﬁed, can the coach start to ﬁnd ways to incorporate these
into their routine.
A host of writers have offered different strategies for reﬂective practice. Here are
a few examples for consideration:
Schon (1983) suggested the following stages:
•
Puzzlement: ‘What the hell just happened? Or, what the hell is happening?’
•
Comparison: ‘How have I really been doing this until now?’
•
Opportunity to experiment: What can I gain/learn/get/know from this?
Bain, Ballantyne, Packer, and Mills (1999) identify ﬁve levels of reﬂection:
1. Reporting
2. Responding
3. Relating
4. Reasoning
5. Reconstructing.
Moon (2004) refers to four levels:
Level 0: Description of what happened (reporting).
Level 1: Descriptive writing with some reﬂective potential. Reference to impact of
events and indication of points where reﬂection could occur.
Level 2: Reﬂective writing (1) Reference to the value of exploring motives or
reasons for behavior. Some self-awareness/criticism or possibly reﬂection on
motives of others. This stage is sometimes described as relating or reasoning.
Level 3: Reﬂective writing (2) There is clear evidence here of the learner standing
back from an event, of mulling it over and holding an internal dialogue. There is
awareness of the learning involved and how it will be used in the future direction.
This phase is sometimes described as reconstructing.
Henley8 Model for Self-reﬂection
In our coach training we encourage our coaches to use eight practical questions.
These eight questions are a handrail to guide the reﬂective process. They provide one
way to structure our thinking (see Box 30.1).
In the Henley8 model the starting point is to notice: what did I observe? This
requires situational awareness, being fully present and noticing changes in events
around us. The observation may be a change in the situation, for example a ﬁre bell
rings during the team meeting. It may be observing a behavior of an individual, or an
event.
Henley8 Model for Self-reﬂection
227

The second step is to identify our response: what was my response? This may be
behavioral, but is likely to also be cognitive (what was I thinking and why?) and also:
what was I feeling? Our thoughts and feelings often drive our behavior and recog-
nizing the relationship between these is helpful, and how these are associated with
the trigger event (what we have observed).
Behind these initial feelings and thoughts are likely to be beliefs and values.
Being conscious of these, and bringing these core beliefs to mind, will help us make
more sense of our own response.
The third and fourth aspects of reﬂection involve considering what these behav-
iors, thoughts, feelings, and possibly our beliefs and values say about us as an
individual, and what they say about us as a leader, reﬂective practitioner or coach
within the context in which we are working. Meaning can vary widely depending on
the organizational and national culture and taking these into account needs to be part
of our reﬂection.
The ﬁfth and sixth questions explore the pros and cons of these beliefs. How do
these beliefs or attitudes help or hinder us in our role? Do they make us more
effective? Do they contribute to our happiness and well-being? Do they contribute
positively to our team or others? What do we need to be aware of in terms of how we
can build on these positives and what we should guard against?
The seventh and eighth questions are what we learn and may take away from the
reﬂection. They set the stage for future development. Reﬂection without action is
meaningless. The purpose of reﬂection is to understand ourselves and others more
deeply and, through this, to learn and adapt in the future to enhance our own
effectiveness and that of others.
Box 30.1 Henley8 Question
1. What did I observe?
2. What was my response?
3. What does this tell me about me?
4. What does this tell me about myself as a coach or leader?
5. What strengths does this offer?
6. What are the potential pitfalls?
7. What did I learn?
8. What might I do differently next time?
We have suggested in Chap. 1 that the coach creates a personal learning journal
and starts the practice of regularly using this for their reﬂections. This may be after
each coaching session, where the coach spends 10–15 min reﬂecting on the session
using the Henley8 questions, or it may be at the end of each day or week, reﬂecting
back over the sessions in that day or that week. The frequency will depend on how
much coaching you are doing and your own schedule. What important is ﬁnding a
pattern which works for you. If you ﬁnd you are not regularly writing in your journal,
228
30
Reﬂective Practice

we suggest you review your routine and ﬁnd a time which will enable you to make
this part of your practice.
Of course, there are several aspects to consider when writing your learning
journal. The ﬁrst is to avoid the use of client names (use initials which you may
recognize, but others can’t) and avoid the use of organizational names or facts that
identify the organization. By excluding personal data, you can be more relaxed about
the security of your learning journal. The second issue is about reviewing what you
have reﬂected on. There are several ways of doing this, ﬁrstly taking issues from the
learning journal to your supervision. If for whatever reason you have decided not to
use supervision, we suggest ﬁnding a way to review and reﬂect on patterns or themes
which may be arising each quarter, and scheduling time in your diary. Without a
formal pattern of supervision, it is easy for this to be missed, which is why allowing
an hour or two each quarter in your diary ensures that the learning can be incorpo-
rated into new behaviors, or into your personal development plan.
Box 30.2 Example of Reﬂective Writing Using the Henley8
I noticed that Kate was late for the meeting. She came in and apologized.
I observed that my response to this lateness was I had been clicking my pen
while I was waiting and that my heart rate had risen. I was conscious that I was
irritated by her lateness. I was thinking she is wasting my time when I am so
busy at present and could have done with that extra 15 min.
This tells me that timekeeping is very important to me. A commitment is a
commitment, and that my interpretation of her lateness was that she was being
rude. This tells me that I can be intolerant to others in certain circumstances
and that breaking these unwritten rules leads me to be judgmental.
As a coach, it tells me that certain behaviors can lead me to starting sessions
in a judgmental mind-frame, and that this may interrupt my client mindset of
being open, curious, ﬂexible, and client-centered.
The strengths of being highly sensitive to timekeeping are that I am never
likely to be late for a meeting. I always leave sufﬁcient time and extra for client
meetings.
The pitfall is that if I am, or others are late, this can be a signiﬁcant hurdle to
recovering the relationship and getting started on the coaching process. The
irritation does not quickly pass and can pervade the whole session.
What I learned about myself was that it would be helpful to change my
belief: this is their time and thus how they choose to use it is their responsi-
bility and choice, not mine; I will still ﬁnish at the agreed upon time.
What I might do differently next time is to be clear with client that we have
an hour, with a starting time at point A and a ﬁnishing time at point B, 60 min
later. It is then their responsibility to make choices about how the hour is used.
I will bring something to do, so I can make the best use of any down time
should this happen in future coaching meetings.

Conclusion
In this chapter we have reviewed the importance of reﬂective practice. We have
argued that it is central to coach development, but also to an essential for all coaches,
and helps us to retain a ‘Beginner’s Mind’ set, which allows us to remain open,
curious, ﬂexible and client-centered, whether we have 50 hours of practice or
5000 hours. We have also suggested that using several frameworks, including the
Henley8, as a way for the coach to structure and capture their reﬂections and develop
new insights for their practice.

Mentor Coaching
Introduction
As part of a self-regulating industry, coaches can provide consistent value to their
clients by actively engaging in Continuing Professional Development (CPD) activ-
ities so that they can ensure that their skills are still active, current, relevant, and of a
high standard. Such professional development can come in many different forms and
is covered in more detail in Chap. 28. This chapter focuses on a speciﬁc form of
professional development: Mentor Coaching.
What Is Mentor Coaching?
There is sometimes confusion around what Mentor Coaching is when it comes to its
deﬁnition and scope of activity. From personal experience in this ﬁeld, it is proposed
that Mentor Coaching tends to fall into two different categories of: General Coach
Mentoring and Mentor Coaching for International Coaching Federation (ICF)
Credentialing purposes.
General Coach Mentoring
General Coach Mentoring is quite closely aligned with what we probably understand
by mentoring as a discipline. It is typically a relationship in which a more experi-
enced or more knowledgeable person helps to guide a less experienced or less
knowledgeable person. The mentor may be older or younger than the person being
mentored, but she or he must have a certain area of expertise. It is a learning and

231

development partnership between someone with considerable experience and some-
one who wants to learn.
Given this deﬁnition, the scope of this kind of mentoring could be very broad and
could cover a range of areas from competency development to building and
maintaining a coaching practice or business. Within this broad range, some of the
topics the mentee might bring into the conversation with their mentor could even be
considered as supervision inquiries, and so we now see a crossover with yet another
way of working.
Supervision is a very speciﬁc form of professional development, as explored in
Chap. 29 and also requires the supervisor to have undertaken specialist training in
this ﬁeld. Mentor Coaching for ICF Credentialing is also a very speciﬁc form of
professional development, again requiring particular skills and attributes. To that
end, it is important that the coach seeking any of these services gains clarity about
what is being offered, along with ensuring the person they are thinking of working
with has the appropriate skills, qualiﬁcations and experience to provide that service.
It is therefore proposed that, in practice, there are three different services that in some
ways cross over: general mentoring, mentor coaching for credentialing and super-
vision. Furthermore, with mentor coaching for credentialing and supervision being
so much more clearly deﬁned and scoped, it is proposed that general coach
mentoring services need to be carefully contracted for in order for the coach to
understand exactly what is the service they will be receiving and how will that be of
value to their professional development.
A ﬁnal note on this is that these services may be provided by different individuals
or the same person, thereby once again implying the need for clarity of what is being
offered and in which modality you are working.
Mentor Coaching for ICF Credentialing
This form of professional development is recognized by the ICF and its purpose is to
provide professional assistance in achieving and demonstrating the levels of
coaching competency demanded by the desired credential level sought by a coach-
applicant (mentee). This way of working is deﬁned and consists of coaching and
feedback in a collaborative, appreciative and dialogued process based on observed or
recorded coaching session(s) to increase the coach’s capability in coaching, in
alignment with the ICF Core Competencies.
Mentor Coaching should take place over an extended time (for a minimum of
3 months) in a cycle that allows for listening and feedback from the Mentor coach
while also allowing reﬂection and practice on the part of the individual being
mentored. Furthermore, Mentor Coaching means an applicant (mentee) being
coached on their coaching skills rather than coaching on practice building, life
balance, or other topics unrelated to the development of an applicant’s coaching
skill.

When Do I Need Mentor Coaching?
Mentor Coaching is a very useful and valuable way of working and developing our
coaching competence and is undertaken at various points in a coach’s development
as follows:
1. Mentor Coaching as part of an initial ICF Credential application
2. Mentor Coaching as part of an ICF Credential renewal
3. Mentor Coaching as part of a coach’s general professional development
Mentor Coaching as Part of an Initial ICF Credential
Application
As noted in the Introduction to Section “What Is Mentor Coaching?”, part of the
application process for all three levels of ICF Credential (ACC, PCC, and MCC)
requires the applicant to complete 10 h of Mentor Coaching as deﬁned and outlined
above. Some coach training schools offer Mentor Coaching as part of their program-
ming and others do not. As such, Mentor Coaching is also a service that is offered by
certain coaches within the ICF Credentialed community as well as by ICF-accredited
schools.
Mentor Coaching as Part of an ICF Credential Renewal
As outlined in the Introduction to Section “What Is Mentor Coaching?”, the ICF
credentialing system is based on the credential being renewed every 3 years. When a
coach holding an ACC credential seeks to renew their credential at that same level,
they need to complete an additional 10 h of Mentor Coaching as part of their renewal
process. The rationale for this is that if, in the last 3 year period, they have not built
up enough coaching client hours to take them from the 100 h required for ACC to the
500 h required for PCC, this additional checkpoint is put in place via the Mentor
Coaching process. This is to ensure that the coach is in fact still current in their
coaching skills and is still consistently offering coaching in alignment with the
required ACC standard of coaching as per the ICF Core Competencies. The 10-h
of Mentor Coaching completed can also be counted toward the 40 h of professional
development and Continuing Coach Education (CCE) across that 3-year period
required for the renewal process.
Coaches who are renewing their credentials at the levels of PCC or MCC are not
required to do this extra 10 h of Mentor Coaching. However, Mentor Coaching is
considered to be a very valuable form of professional development. As such, PCC
When Do I Need Mentor Coaching?
233

and MCC credentialed coaches can complete and apply up to 10 h of Mentor
Coaching as part of the 40 h of CPD required for their credential renewal.
Mentor Coaching as Part of a Coach’s General Professional
Development
As noted above, Mentor Coaching offers a great form of professional development
for any coach and is a highly recommended practice for ICF credentialed coaches to
engage in periodically with a Mentor.
How Does Mentor Coaching Work?
As previously noted, the purpose of Mentor Coaching is to support the coach
(mentee) to develop their coaching skills against the ICF Core Competency frame-
work. Such development is pitched at whatever is the relevant credential level for
that mentee and comprises a full and in-depth review of the ICF Core Competency
framework, the ICF Code of Ethics and how the mentee is or is not demonstrating the
competencies in their coaching practice. The coach’s demonstration of coaching
competence could be explored and worked with in several ways:
•
Using recordings of client sessions (these need to be real client examples for
which the client has given their permission for their session to be used for
mentoring purposes).
•
Coaches coaching each other in live group webinar sessions
•
The coach (mentee) coaching the Mentor
The ICF partnered with the Association of Coach Training Organizations
(ACTO) to produce a set of duties and competencies of Mentor Coaches. The duties
of the Mentor are described in Box 31.1.
Box 31.1 Duties of a Mentor Coach
1. Model effective initiation and contracting of client relationship
2. Explore fully with a potential mentee what they are looking to achieve
3. Ensure both are clear about the purpose of the mentoring
4. Establish measures of success in partnership with the mentee
5. Fully discuss fees, time frame, and other aspects of a Mentor Coaching
relationship
6. Inform the mentee regarding all aspects of the ICF Code of Ethics
7. Inform the mentee of the availability of the Ethical Conduct Review Board
(continued)
234
31
Mentor Coaching

Box 31.1 (continued)
8. Support mentee self‐conﬁdence by encouraging potential mentees to
interview more than one mentor coach candidate in order to ﬁnd the
best match
9. Make no guarantee to the mentee that as a result of the mentoring the
mentee will obtain the credential level s/he is seeking
10. Focus on core competency development by reviewing and providing oral
and written feedback on a series of the mentee’s coaching session.
(a) These sessions are to be conducted one at a time, with a feedback
session between each one, giving enough time between sessions to
allow for incorporation of the mentee’s learning and development.
11. Provide speciﬁc verbal and/or written feedback, using targeted examples
from the sessions so that:
(a) The mentee will know exactly what s/he is doing well.
(b) The mentee understands what needs to be done to develop a deeper
level of mastery in coaching.
12. Demonstrate that s/he is learning about the mentee at many levels at once
and is able to hold all of that in the context of:
(a) Who the mentee is
(b) What the mentee is seeking
(c) Honoring the mentee’s unique style
This list of duties provides a good overview of what one can expect to be covered
across a series of mentor coaching sessions.
In practice, these sessions can be designed in many different ways and part of the
initial contracting process with the mentor would be to discuss and decide upon a
mentor coaching plan based upon the speciﬁc needs and development goals of the
mentee.
The 10-h of mentor coaching can be undertaken on a completely 1–1 basis or as
blend of 1–1 and group mentoring work. The ICF requires that a maximum of 7 h of
mentoring can be undertaken in a group setting (with a maximum of 10 mentees in a
group). There is no “right or wrong” way to approach this and it is down to personal
preference, timing and budgeting as to which way might be preferable for the
mentee. Accredited schools offering mentoring and individual mentors who offers
group work may provide this as part of a structured program, whereas fully 1–1
mentoring is down to the mentee and mentor to schedule themselves.
Mentor Coaching could be undertaken on a face to face basis, however most
mentoring nowadays tends done via a virtual platform of some kind, thereby
How Does Mentor Coaching Work?
235

beneﬁtting from the associated time and cost savings. The 10 h are typically
completed in 1- to 2-h sessions using the examples of client work noted above. As
stated in the duties above, these sessions are to be “conducted one at a time, with a
feedback session between each one, giving enough time between sessions to allow
for incorporation of the mentee’s learning and development”. This means that the
10 h are a blend of reviewing, discussing and sharing feedback on a series of
recordings (or live coaching sessions) ensuring that all aspects of the ICF Core
Competencies and the ICF Code of Ethics are covered across the period of time
taken for this work.
The ICF’s requirement that the 10 h of mentor coaching is completed across a
minimum of a 3-month period is so that there can be evidence of the mentee applying
their learning and integrating it into their coaching practice for the mentor to observe
that development when they review another piece of client work. This means that,
whilst the minimum period for completion is 3 months, in practice the 10 h may take
longer to undertake. This might depend upon how much client work the mentee
currently has (in order to integrate their learning and also to secure additional
recorded examples), the availability of the mentee and mentor and the mentees
chosen timeline for this exercise. Personal experience as a mentor has shown that
typically mentor coaching packages can easily take anything up to 6 or even
9 months to complete.
Planning Your Mentor Coaching Sessions
There are several aspects to consider when planning your mentor coaching package
including when, how and with whom.
The ﬁrst aspect of planning your mentor coaching sessions is to consider when to
start this part of the process.
As for when, this is partly personal choice, however in the case of an ACC
credential renewal, the timing will be indicated by the renewal cycle. For ﬁrst time
credential applications, it is recommended that two factors are taken into
consideration:
1. The purpose of the mentoring is to assist the mentee in demonstrating their
coaching competence in relation to the level of credential they are going to
apply for (or renew in the case of ACC). To that end, apart from being a highly
developmental process, mentoring is also an assessment preparation process. This
means that, wherever possible, it is useful to time the mentoring activity so that
there is a minimal time gap between its completion and the mentee applying for
their credential and undertaking the assessment process for that purpose. In this
way, the mentee’s knowledge of the Core Competencies and the Code of Ethics
are fresh and current, which is helpful for their completion of the Coach Knowl-
edge Assessment (CKA) as outlined in Chap. 32. In addition, the mentee needs to
ﬁnd one (for an ACC credential application) or two (for PCC and MCC credential
236
31
Mentor Coaching

applications) recordings of them demonstrating their coaching skills and evidenc-
ing the competencies. As such the process of mentoring, which works with
recordings of coaching sessions, is a great opportunity to explore ﬁnding those
recordings for submission, especially during the latter part of the mentoring
process, when the mentees skills are hopefully most developed.
2. Because mentoring has a very practical aspect to it, in that mentee and mentor are
actively reviewing and working with real examples of coaching, it is ideal that the
mentee engages in this work at a time when they are actively coaching a variety of
clients. In this way, they can make best use of the opportunity to integrate their
learning and keep building the coaching “muscles” alongside the opportunity to
review, reﬂect and receive feedback from the mentor.
Regarding how to complete a mentor coaching package, once again personal
choice will prevail. There are several factors that one might consider as follows:
•
One-on-one mentoring can offer most ﬂexibility in terms of diary planning and
the mentee also gets personal, in-depth, one-on-one attention and focus across the
whole 10 h.
•
However, it could also take longer, possibly be more expensive and the beneﬁt of
working with other coaches, exchanging ideas, and learning from each other is
not available.
•
Group mentoring sessions need to be scheduled for a whole group and are often
therefore ﬁxed as part of a program.
•
However, some mentees prefer the structure a program offers, and the process can
sometimes be completed more quickly and with the beneﬁt or working with
colleagues in a safe and collaborative environment.
•
With group mentoring, the mentee also still has the opportunity of 3 h of one-on-
one work with their mentor.
Finally, and regarding with whom to work, the mentee does not have to complete
all of their 10 h of mentoring with the same mentor, although in practice many
mentees do. One word of recommendation for mentees who do choose to work with
more than one mentor is that the overarching mentoring package should ultimately
cover the whole competency framework and code of ethics and so some level of
coordination is required to ensure this is the case when working with multiple
mentors.
This next section offers more guidance on how to ﬁnd and choose a mentor.
Finding a Mentor Coach
There are several ways to ﬁnd a Mentor Coach, including via:
•
ICF Accredited coach training schools: will either offer mentoring services
directly or can often recommend or put the mentee in touch with potential
mentors know within their community
Finding a Mentor Coach
237

•
ICF Mentor Coach registry: some Mentors register their services on the ICF
Global website and are listed for the mentee to browse and choose some to
contact for an exploratory discussion.
•
ICF Local Chapters: some ICF local chapters also either list or know of Mentors
within their area.
•
Word of mouth: this is a common way for Mentors and Mentees to ﬁnd each
other.
Whichever way the mentee ﬁnds a mentor, it is important to note that working
with a mentor does not guarantee a successful credential application. It is highly
recommended that mentees undertake a proper selection process to ensure that they
are working with someone who is appropriately skilled, qualiﬁed and experienced
and who is going to work with the mentee in a way that creates safety, support and
useful, developmental feedback.
In order to assist with that process, the guidelines set out by ICF and ACTO
(2020) also propose some of the personal traits and competencies a Mentor Coach
should display:
Box 31.2 Personal Traits and Competencies of a Mentor Coach
Personal Traits
The ICF Mentor Coach:
1. Is trustworthy and has the ability to connect with the mentee in terms of ﬁt,
chemistry, and compatibility.
2. Is someone who encourages the mentee to reach beyond what the mentee
initially feels is possible, assisting in broadening their creative process.
3. Demonstrates equal partnership by being open, vulnerable and willing to
take appropriate risks, for example, in providing feedback that may make
one or both individuals uncomfortable.
4. Understands and is able to model the value of partnership and, as an
example, allows/encourages the mentee to lead in designing areas to be
worked on between sessions that will lead to more powerful, leveraged
coaching.
5. Has the ability to be supportive and authentic in celebrating who the mentee
is, her/his achievements and growth throughout the process.
6. Is secure in their own work and is able to demonstrate appreciation and
respect for the unique style of each mentee.
7. Encourages the development of the mentee’s own coaching style
8. Is willing to hold both self and mentee accountable for performance and to
periodically encourage mutual assessment of the effectiveness of the
relationship
(continued)

Box 31.2 (continued)
Competencies
The ICF Mentor Coach:
1. Listens beyond content to discern application of the skills related to the
core. Competencies (i.e. skill versus direction, skill versus style or skill
versus outcome for the client).
2. Listens on all levels: physical, intellectual, emotional, and intuitive.
3. Listens equally for strengths and areas for growth.
4. Is aware of and allows for differences in style, culture, and language.
5. Has a working knowledge of the assessment tools used by the ICF in the
evaluation of recorded coaching sessions used in the credentialing exam
process.
6. Listens both for the presence of individual competencies and for the
overall totality of skill level.
7. Has the ability to distinguish which critical underlying competency(-ies)
may be giving rise to ineffective or limited coaching impact.
8. Can discern and articulate the gap between levels of skill demonstrated
and next skill level to attain.
9. Discerns and articulates areas of growth, competency use, and skill level
using competency-based language and speciﬁc behavioral examples from
the coaching.
10. Creates a safe and trusting space for the delivery of feedback, using a
respectful, clear, judgment-free tone.
11. Articulates with speciﬁc detail and examples, what is being observed and
the speciﬁc development needed to move to the next skill level, delivered
with sensitivity to the impact of the feedback.
12. Offers feedback that is relevant to each speciﬁc coaching core compe-
tency, recognizing strengths as well as potential growth areas.
13. Demonstrates the ability to self‐manage relative to any coaching model
preferences and stay focused on the skill assessment related to the core
coaching competencies.
A ﬁnal note on ﬁnding a Mentor Coach is that they can Mentor for credentials up
to the level of their own credential. In the case of Mentors holding an ACC
credential, they must have held their credential for at least 3 years and renewed it
at least once in order to be eligible to mentor others.

Getting the Best Out of Your Mentor Coaching Experience
Although Mentor Coaching is a requirement for a credential application (and ACC
credential renewals), it would be a wasted opportunity if this were treated as a “tick-
box” exercise. Mentor Coaching can be a very rich and rewarding developmental
experience. In addition, through the process of mentoring, the mentee becomes much
more deeply familiar with the ICF Core Competencies and the Code of Ethics and
can thereby leave the mentoring process equipped with a powerful self-reﬂective
tool. This enables them to self-reﬂect periodically by recording their coaching
practice and listening back to the session exploring when, if, and how the compe-
tencies are being evidenced.
Here are some tips for getting the very best out of your Mentor Coaching
package:
•
Do your research and ensure that your mentor is appropriately skilled, qualiﬁed,
and experienced to work with you
•
Check that you have a good rapport and chemistry to work well together in a safe,
collaborative, and developmental environment
•
Contract with your Mentor around your goals for mentoring and all other aspects
of how you will work together (in this way you are also both role modelling and
mirroring the process of contracting and establishing agreements as is done in
good coaching practice).
•
Allow enough time and space for you to fully engage in the learning process.
•
Plan ahead and consider which clients you will ask for their permission to record
your work with them for this purpose.
•
Consider how much coaching client work you currently have so that you have
sufﬁcient opportunity for ongoing practice and integration of your learning as the
mentoring process evolves.
•
Think about your preferred timeline. How long do you want to take for this
important development
activity? How
will
it
ﬁt alongside
your
other
commitments?
•
Listen to your own work! Your Mentor will listen to your recorded client work
and then discuss it with you and share feedback. However, listening to your own
work is an incredibly powerful way to develop, and will most certainly enhance
your learning experience. When listening to your work, consider when, if, and
how you feel you are evidencing the competencies. When you then debrief the
work with your mentor, you can explore your own understand and accuracy of
identifying the competencies, thus enhancing your own knowledge for ongoing
and future self-reﬂection.
•
Consider your mindset for doing this work so that you can bring openness and a
desire to learn and develop and receive useful, albeit at times challenging,
feedback in service of your professional growth.
•
Once your mentoring package is completed, take the process forward by keeping
up with your own reﬂective practice by periodically recording and reviewing your
client work. This can also be a great activity for a peer group of coaches to
240
31

undertake; coaching each other followed by review and debrief against the Core
Competencies or by using examples from your shared client work (with the
client’s permission of course).
Conclusion
In this chapter we have positioned Mentor Coaching as powerful professional
development tool for coaches as well as outlining how it is a required part of the
ICF credential application process. We have covered the when, how and with whom
of mentoring as well how to get the best out of this process.

Chapter 32
Coach Knowledge Assessment
Introduction
This chapter introduces the ICF Coach Knowledge Assessment (CKA), explains its
purpose and describes the assessment process (ICF, 2020a). We also look at how you
can best prepare for this assessment for a successful outcome.
What Is the Coach Knowledge Assessment?
The Coach Knowledge Assessment (CKA) is an online assessment tool that is used
by the ICF to measure a coach’s understanding of the knowledge and skills that are
important in the practice of coaching. Speciﬁcally, it tests coaches on a body of
knowledge including the ICF deﬁnition of coaching, the Core Competencies and the
Code of Ethics.
As outlined in the Introduction to Section “What Is the Coach Knowledge
Assessment?”, the CKA is a required element of ACC, PCC and MCC credential
applications. The purpose of this assessment step is to offer a standardized and
scientiﬁcally constructed test to underpin fairness and rigor in the credentialing
process and it is created from the Competency Job Analysis process also described
in the Introduction to Section “What Is the Coach Knowledge Assessment?”. Whilst
this test measures knowledge, the application of that knowledge is then assessed by
the review of actual coaching sessions.
The CKA is periodically reviewed and updated, however its typical format is that
it comprises around 155 multiple choice items. Each item contains a short statement
or a question with four possible answers. For each item, there is one answer that ICF
has established as being the best response.
The test covers the four domains of the ICF Core Competency model: Founda-
tion, Co-Creating the Relationship, Communicating Effectively and Cultivating

243

Learning and Growth as well as the eight competencies that sit underneath those
domains. The test items are related to the ICF deﬁnition of coaching, the core
competencies and the code of ethics and they vary in levels of difﬁculty. Some of
the items are intended to assess the coach’s awareness of a coaching concept or skill
and others present a scenario that requires the coach to be able to demonstrate a
deeper understanding for the correct response to be identiﬁed.
Here are a couple of examples:
Box 32.1 Examples from the Coach Knowledge Assessment
Domain: Foundation:
The client is a high-energy manager with a generally positive outlook. Just
before coming to the coaching session, the client was told that their responsi-
bilities are about to drastically change and will no longer be doing the work
they are passionate about. The client has come to the session in a particularly
negative mood and has expressed the desire to address this situation in today’s
session. What is the BEST way for the coach to proceed?
(a) Ask the client about all of the potential positive outcomes from this
situation
(b) Remind the client that the agenda for this session was set at the last
session.
(c) Explore the outcomes for the session and ensure the client and coach
are both clear on them.
(d) Point out to the client how extremely important it is to be passionate about
the work we do.
Domain: Communicating Effectively:
When dealing with a client who brings many issues to the table, it is best for
the coach pick the option:
(a) Where the coach has the most experience
(b) Of asking what the client would like to start with
(c) That looks most likely to be handled in the time available
(d) That the coach thinks can do the most good for the client
In practical terms, the coach completes the CKA at some point during the
credential application process. The exact timing of this will depend upon which
type of credential application path the coach is following (these different paths are
dependent upon what type of coach-speciﬁc training the coach has completed and
details can be found on the ICF website). The test will be received via a link in an
email to the coach and, upon receipt of the link, the coach has 60 days within which
to complete the test.
Once the link is opened, the test needs to be completed in one sitting (there is not a
“save and continue later” option) and a total of 3-h are given for this process before
244
32
Coach Knowledge Assessment

the online session expires. In most cases, coaches complete the test in less time
(usually around 2-h). Once completed, the results of the test will be available
immediately and sent directly to the coach via email. The pass mark for the CKA
can also change over time as the questions and test items are reviewed and updated
periodically, however the pass mark is typically around 70%.
The score will be broken down into a score for each of the four domain test areas,
and no feedback is given regarding any incorrect responses. However, feedback is
given for the recorded coaching sessions that are also submitted as part of the
assessment process for a credential application. If a coach does not pass the test
ﬁrst time, it can be taken again, at an additional cost, with a maximum of the test
being taken twice a quarter. However, if a coach is well trained, has completed their
mentoring and prepared for the test, repeating this part of the process will hopefully
not be necessary.
How Can I Best Prepare for the Coach Knowledge
Assessment?
Preparation for you sitting the CKA actually starts when you enroll and begin your
coach training. Coach training programs that have been accredited by the ICF
(ACTP and ACSTH programs) are required to include the ICF deﬁnition of
coaching, the Core Competencies and the Code of Ethics within their curriculum
and so you will have received instruction and feedback during your coaching
practice sessions that is in alignment with that body of knowledge.
In addition, the Mentor Coaching process as described in Chap. 31, provides
another opportunity to discuss, review and reﬂect upon these areas, thereby deep-
ening the coach’s knowledge and understanding.
Advice for Taking the Online Assessment
When it comes to taking the test, here are a few tips to help you:
•
Once you receive the link to sit the exam, make sure that you look at your diary
and plan ahead so that you can comfortably allocate some time to prepare for the
test and also the time needed to take the test.
•
As part of your ﬁnal preparations, review and digest the following materials:
– Your coach training manuals and notes
– Your Mentor Coaching notes and feedback
– The ICF Core Competency Model
– The ICF Code of Ethics
Advice for Taking the Online Assessment
245

– Other ICF competency-related documentation as referenced in the Introduc-
tion to Section “What Is the Coach Knowledge Assessment?”.
•
Have the above materials to hand when you sit the test. The CKA is not intended
to be a “memory” test, it is more like an open-book exam and you can have these
materials around you, which will provide useful sources of reference when
considering your responses to the questions.
•
On the day, create a comfortable, quiet, distraction free environment for yourself
so that you can complete the test undisturbed.
•
Finally, relax!
Conclusion
In this chapter, we have given an overview of the Coach Knowledge Assessment
tool as part of the ICF Credential application process. We have provided an overview
of the purpose and format of the test, along with some example questions. We have
also shared some advice on how to get prepared for this test for a most successful
outcome. More details and resources for this test are available from the ICF website.

Chapter 33
Progressing your Coaching Skills
Introduction
The completion of the ACC accreditation is only the ﬁrst step in your coaching
journey. Most coaches aspire to become a PCC or an MCC. The journey toward
these is based on reﬂective practice, during which the coach continues to apply their
skills, builds their experience as a coach and also engages in further coach training.
In this chapter we will explain the requirements for PCC and MCC and how you
might plan your journey to achieving these standards over the coming few years. If
you are already an MCC, we will also look at coach maturity and invite you to think
about your own personal journey for development to retain the beginner mind in
your practice.
What is PCC?
PCC stands for Professional Certiﬁed Coach and is intended to offer a benchmark for
a gold standard of coaching offered. Some coaches progress toward their PCC
credential having ﬁrst successfully secured their ACC credential and other coaches
apply for their PCC straight away, if they fulﬁll the relevant criteria and require-
ments. There is no right or wrong approach and it often hinges largely on the amount
of coaching an individual is undertaking, which in turn inﬂuences the speed at which
the coach can build their client hours and their experience.
Whilst the ACC is a highly reputable and globally recognized credential, many
coaches choose to continue with their development in the ﬁeld of coaching and aim
for the PCC. Coaches who remain at the level of ACC are those who are probably
using their coaching skills less and for whom coaching is perhaps a smaller part of
their overarching role.

247

Individuals who practice coaching as a signiﬁcant or complete part of their work,
are recommended to consider pursuing their PCC credential at some point. As
coaching is now so widely recognized as a powerful developmental way of working,
many organizations are increasingly aware of the credentialing levels and often
require that professional coaches who offer their services within those organizations
hold at least a PCC level credential. On this note of organizational client expecta-
tions, there is also an increasing expectation in some organizations that coaches are
engaged in regular supervision as part of their ongoing professional development
and reﬂective practice. See Chap. 29 for more information about Coaching
Supervision.
What Do I Need to Do to Achieve PCC Status?
As outlined in the Introduction to Section “What is PCC?”, a PCC credential requires
a greater amount of coach-speciﬁc training and coaching experience as compared to
an ACC credential (Table 33.1).
The training hours and the coaching experience hours are incremental. For
example, once a coach has completed at least 100 hours of coaching experience
for their ACC application, they then continue to coach and build up at least another
400 hours, making a total of at least 500 hours in total to be eligible to apply for their
PCC. The same principle applies to the coach-speciﬁc training hours.
The other difference in requirements for PCC compared to ACC is that for an
ACC credential application, one example of a client session is submitted for assess-
ment and for a PCC application, two examples are required.
What Differentiates the PCC Coach from an ACC Coach?
Apart from the obvious aspects noted above that a PCC coach will have completed
more coach-speciﬁc training and undertaken more hours of client work, the PCC
level coach is expected to know, understand and demonstrate the ICF Core Compe-
tencies to a greater level of depth.

Progressing your Coaching Skills

The ICF Core Competency framework is a single body of work that is applicable
to and relevant for all three levels of credential. It is therefore the depth of under-
standing and demonstration of that framework that typically differentiates coaching
at the three credential levels. Here follow some examples of how that might show up
in practice. An important point to note when reading these differentiators is that they
are reﬂections on ACC or PCC level coaching, as per the Core Competency model,
and are not an evaluation or judgment of the coach. For example, a coach may
currently hold an ACC credential; however they may in practice be coaching more at
the level of PCC.
Coaching Mindset
The PCC level coach is likely to be one who is quite fully committed to and invested
in the practice of coaching and as such is engaging in ongoing learning, development
and reﬂective practice in perhaps a more structured, consistent, focused and in-depth
manner. This is in no way an indication that an ACC level coach has less commit-
ment to their work and their development; it is merely the fact that, for a PCC level
coach, coaching and coaching development probably forms a greater part of their
professional identity.
At PCC level, a coach is expected to be more comfortable and skilled at accessing
and using their own intuition for the beneﬁt of their client’s. Whereas at ACC level
the coach is likely to be more focused on the technicality of the coaching process and
competencies and, as such, may either not notice, access or be comfortable utilizing
their intuition in their coaching practice.
Coaching Agreements
Whilst three key levels of coaching agreements are outlined in the Core Competency
model, the extent to which these agreements are explored and established may vary
signiﬁcantly from ACC to PCC level coaching. Part of what is evaluated in this
competency is the depth of creation of the agreement(s) and the degree to which the
coach demonstrates they are able to fully partner with their client in that creation.
At ACC level, the coach is expected to establish what the client wants to work on
and then proceed to attend to that coaching agenda. In essence, the focus at ACC
level is on the “what” of the coaching topic. Whereas at PCC level, there is likely to
be a much deeper, richer exploration of “why” the topic is of signiﬁcance and
importance to the client and perhaps “why now” this topic has emerged as a topic
for conversation. Furthermore, at PCC level, we may also see an exploration into the
“who” of the client that is bringing the topic. This deeper exploration can also
include aspects of the following skills:
What Differentiates the PCC Coach from an ACC Coach?
249

•
Asks and explores with the client what they want to work on (this might include
exploring what the topic really is, as opposed to what is initially presented by the
client)
•
Explores and conﬁrms that the agenda is meaningful for the client and will move
the client toward a desired outcome(s)
•
Engages in some exploration of the measures of success for each outcome desired
in the session
•
Engages in some exploration of the issues related to each outcome
•
Attends to that agenda, those measures, and those issues throughout the coaching
•
May raise unseen issues to the client, but will not change agendas, measures, or
issues unless redirected by the client
•
Should also check with the client during the session to make sure that the client’s
goals for the session are in fact being achieved and/or if the goals are evolving or
changing.
Although all of the Core Competencies are important, the competency of “Estab-
lishes and Maintains Agreements” is critical to the successful foundation of a
coaching conversation and a thorough review of Chap. 8 which describes this
competency is highly recommended.
Trust and Safety
At all levels, the coach is expected to demonstrate genuine concern and respect for
their client and to create a safe, open environment in which to work, adapting their
own style if necessary, in order to do so. However, at PCC level, the coach is
expected to be more comfortable and skilled at allowing space and support for full
client expression as well as being highly attuned to the client’s style and way of
being.
Presence
As the credential levels progress there is an expectation of increasing ability and
conﬁdence with being able to work with the client’s expression of emotions (espe-
cially strong emotions) and to manage one’s own emotions. This also applies to
developing a level of comfort working with the unknown and maintaining an open
curious mindset allowing space and silence for reﬂection (for both the client and the
coach) as opposed to slipping into a need to begin suggesting or “ﬁxing”. As such,
coaching presence also speaks to the level of self-awareness and personal develop-
ment of the coach and this is expected to be increasingly evident for each credential
level.

Progressing your Coaching Skills

Active Listening and Evoking Awareness
At ACC level, the coach is expected to be fully engaged and to listen attentively to
their client. This includes listening with the eyes and noticing how the client’s body
language is also a form of communication. ACC level coaching also expects the
coach to bring a stance of inquiry vs. telling and to ask questions that attend to the
client’s agenda.
At PCC level, the depth of listening is expected to go further to include a curiosity
about what is not being said, to noticing and exploring subtle shifts in the client’s
energy and to noticing and exploring patterns or themes in the session or across the
coaching engagement. PCC level coaching also expects the coach to evoke aware-
ness by asking questions which are less focused on the “data” or “content” of the
coaching topic and more focused on the client who brought that topic and how they
are processing or are thinking and feeling in relation to their topic.
Client Growth
This aspect of the competencies can highlight signiﬁcant differences between ACC
and PCC level coaching. At ACC level, the coach is likely to ask the client about
next steps after the coaching session and also to inquire what the client’s key
takeaways are from the conversation. This level of exploration often leads to this
aspect of the coaching session being relatively brief and contained. Whereas at PCC
level, there is an expectation of a much deeper and richer exploration which includes
inviting the client to consider and summarize their learning and insights from the
session and how that learning will be integrated after the session. There will also be a
more in-depth inquiry around next steps, including how those steps might be taken,
what support or resources might be needed, what might get in the way and how
committed or conﬁdent the client is about those steps being accomplished. As such,
at PCC level this aspect of the coaching may be a longer, fuller inquiry.
What do I Need to do to Achieve MCC Status?
As outlined in the Introduction to Section “What is PCC?”, an MCC credential
requires a greater amount of coach-speciﬁc training and coaching experience as
compared to an ACC or PCC credential (Box 33.1).
Box 33.1 MCC Credential Requirements
Master certiﬁed coach (MCC):
(continued)
What do I Need to do to Achieve MCC Status?
251

Box 33.1 (continued)
•
200+ hours of coach-speciﬁc training
•
10 hours of mentor coaching
•
2500+ hours of coaching experience
•
Coach knowledge assessment (CKA)
•
Core competence performance evaluation to MCC level minimum
requirements
•
Coaches are also required to hold a PCC credential before they can apply
for the MCC credential.
Once again, the training hours and the coaching experience hours are incremental.
For example, once a coach has completed at least the 500-hours of coaching
experience for their PCC application, they then continue to coach and build up at
least another 2000 hours, making a total of at least 2500 hours in total to be eligible
to apply for their MCC. The same principle applies to the coach-speciﬁc training
hours.
Like a PCC application, two examples of a client session are required to be
submitted for assessment and for a MCC application.
What Differentiates the MCC Coach from a PCC Coach?
In line with the transition from ACC to PCC level coaching, MCC level coaching
sees an even greater, deeper and more consistent application of the Core Compe-
tencies. It is also worth noting that, as MCC applicant coaches need to pass and gain
their credential at PCC level before they are eligible to apply for MCC, a signiﬁcant
level of depth of understanding and use of the competencies will have already been
established. Therefore, MCC level coaching is sometimes called coaching “beyond
the competencies” and, as such, the MCC level coach will most likely be displaying
some of the following traits, skills and qualities over and above thorough attention to
the Core Competency framework:
•
Demonstrates and maintains full and complete partnership and a relationship of
trust and equality with the client in all aspects of the coaching work.
•
Thoroughly explores all aspects of the coaching agreement, any potential changes
in direction for the coaching and regularly checks in with the client to ensure
alignment to all agreements.
•
Demonstrates complete trust and conﬁdence in the process of coaching, in their
client and in themselves.
•
Is at ease with silence and creates a spacious environment for the work, regardless
of the length of the coaching session.
•
A sense of ease and naturalness will be evident in the coaching conversation.
252

Progressing your Coaching Skills

•
Can hold an objective and emotional perspective simultaneously and, as such, can
take on the stance of “observer” to the process (immersed and detached
simultaneously).
•
Works with the “who” of the client, the whole person and considers and holds the
client’s context, environment, circumstances and background as rich and relevant
aspects of the coaching work.
•
Is totally at ease with not knowing, working with client emotions, self-regulating
and managing own emotions even when there are moments of discomfort.
•
Is open to and comfortable being vulnerable and is willing to allow the client to
teach the coach.
•
Communicates in a way that is clear and simple and is aligned with their client’s
style.
•
Notices and works with the full range of qualities and gifts the client displays as
well as their limiting beliefs and patterns.
•
Is at ease with and skilled at balancing respect, mutuality and partnership with
challenge and provoking new thought, even if this will make either the coach or
their client, or both, uncomfortable.
•
Is able to share observations, intuitions, and feedback freely and without
attachment.
•
Frequently invites the client’s learning, insights, and intuitions to come forward
and be shared and explored.
•
Supports the client to develop goals, actions, and next steps that achieve more
than just the presenting concerns of the client.
•
Is able to appropriately hold the client to account or discussion if agreed upon
forward movement does not occur.
A Model of Professional Development
Whilst we have the expression to describe the “art and science” of something,
Michael Grinder (2007) proposes that in fact it is the science that usually comes
ﬁrst when we are learning a new skill. We are often drawn to the pursuit of mastery,
actively seeking out the magic of the artistic coaching conversation. However, in
reality, our growth and development as coaches usually means that we go through
learning and understanding the Science of coaching ﬁrst and then we begin to
develop the Art of Coaching. Grinder’s model of professional development for
communication can be easily overlaid onto the process of coaching, as effective
and advanced communication are such core parts of a good coach’s skillset
(Fig. 33.1).
Within these two stages of ﬁrst science and then art, sit four levels of development
(Fig. 33.2).
A Model of Professional Development
253

Science
When we ﬁrst learn to coach, we can be very focused on the content: “what” the
client is saying to us and what we say in return. We may ﬁnd ourselves concerned
that we that we will forget what they have said, that the whole story is important and
that we need to understand the full detail and data of the situation in order to be able
to effectively coach our client. At this stage, we may be very grounded in trying to
coach the topic the client has brought to our session with them. We may also feel that
we need to bring some level of “knowing” or expertise in order to be conﬁdent that
we have added value to the client. As we develop in skill and conﬁdence, we notice
that there is more than simply the content or the words that the client is saying. We
begin to realize that some of this content is not even needed for us to coach our
client—in fact, the content could even get in the way.
There is also then “how” they are saying it and indeed what they are not saying.
We learn that there is more than simply the words and our listening becomes broader,
deeper and more holistic. We ﬁnd ourselves able to expand our attention to the
person bringing the topic as well as the topic itself. We are more observant of body
language, energy, emotion and tone etc.
In summary, Grinder (2007) positions that, in order to learn a new skill, we at ﬁrst
need to understand the science of that skill by establishing some clear guidelines to
help us know what to do or not do. For example:
•
Sometimes...
•
Maybe...
•
Variables...
SCIENCE
&
ART
•
Always do this...
•
Never do that...

Progressing your Coaching Skills

Always ask questions, never give your opinion.
Always allow the client to fully express themselves, never interrupt.
Art
As our development continues, we then begin to expand our own sense of perception
and this enables us to increasingly sense “when” to intervene, when to ask a
question, when to stay silent and allow space and time for reﬂection, when to
challenge, when to probe further and so on. As our own sense of perception with
our clients grows, we ﬁnd ourselves increasingly more present and “in the moment”
with them. We work more ﬂuidly and naturally as we sense our way through the
conversation with the solid foundation of our understanding of the science of
coaching underpinning how we are operating. Our ability to work in this way is
also enabled by our growing level of trust: trust in ourselves as coaches, trust in
clients and trust in the process of coaching.
Enhanced perception allows us to access our own intuition and, as all of these
skills come together, we build higher levels of permission and rapport with our
client. In this way, we also begin to know “if” now is the time to intervene and how
receptive the client might be to what we offer.
At this stage, the somewhat rigid guidelines we needed to follow in the beginning
can be relaxed, like taking the stabilizers from a bike, as we can now maneuver and
navigate more ﬂuidly and conﬁdently. For example:
As a coach, I ask questions to evoke my client’s awareness . . . and sometimes, depending on
the circumstances, I might offer my perspective if I felt it would useful for them.. . . .
As a coach, I encourage my clients to fully express themselves. . .and possibly, if I feel it
might be useful for them, I might interject and invite them to summarize what they feel is the
key issue for them.
What is also very much worth noting, is that this process of navigating the science
and art is in itself a dance, as these two aspects of great coaching interweave, rather
than being a singular, linear learning process. As we transition into ﬁnding our “art”
as a coach, we do not leave the science behind, for it is still there, embedded into the
foundations of our knowledge, training and experience and is in fact built upon as we
continue with our professional development over time.
Retaining the Beginner’s Mind
You may have already become an MCC. It’s tempting at this stage, particularly
when much of your role is helping and supporting other coaches through mentor
coaching, supervision and webinars, to think you have become the expert or guru.
After all you are at the top of the tree.
Retaining the Beginner’s Mind
255

In fact, over the years we know several well-respected coaches who publicly
describe themselves as gurus. In our view this is a very dangerous place to be. As
soon as we start to think of ourselves as an expert or a guru, there is nothing else for
us to learn, and we all know what happens to species that stop learning and
changing—today’s guru is tomorrow’s dinosaur.
To manage this challenge, we suggest a three-step process. Firstly, to acknowl-
edge our expertise, while simultaneously challenging it. We suggest you complete
the sentence: “I know a lot about the current ICF competencies and how these can be
applied, but I am less skilled at . . . . In the next two years I will aim to focus my
learning on thinking about this aspect of my practice.”
Secondly, continuing to foster a beginner’s mind. When you started out you were
probably curious about everything: “How does this work?”, “Why did they say
that?”, “I wonder what that means?”, “What shall I do next?” As we get more
experienced and our knowledge grows, we understand more, or at least we think we
do. In Buddhism, the Beginners Mind is a term used to describe an empty mind. That
is one which holds no preconceived ideas or rules about what is or should be. It is
open, eager and receptive.
Box 33.2 A Zen Parable
A student comes to a famous Zen master and asks for instruction in the way of
Zen Buddhism.
The master begins to discuss several topics of Buddhism like emptiness and
meditation. But the student interrupts the master in an attempt to impress him.
“Oh, I already know all that” says the student.
The master then invites the student to have some tea.
When the tea is ready, the master pours the tea into a teacup, ﬁlling it to the
brim, spilling tea over the sides of the cup and onto the table.
The student exclaims, “stop! You can’t pour tea into a full cup.”
The master replies, “return to me when your cup is empty.”
The master coach needs to remain open and curious.
Thirdly, we suggest the master coach needs to have their own annual personal
development plan and remain actively engaged in collecting CCEU’s and reﬂective
practice such as through supervision. In this way, the master coach, working with a
fellow experienced coach who they know, trust, and respect can be challenged and
stimulated to continue their own personal quest toward maturity. Maturity, like
inﬁnity is a quest, where the pleasure and delight is in the journey, not destination.

Conclusion
In this chapter we have looked at how it is possible to progress from ACC to PCC to
MCC level coaching and have outlined the ICF requirements for each credential
level. We have also considered and described some of the differences between each
level of coaching in terms of the extent to which the Core Competencies are
demonstrated. Finally, we have advocated the adoption of a beginner’s mind:
when the cup is empty, there is still space or it to be ﬁlled with more learning and
growth. As are our clients, so are we. . . .

Part VI
Tools and Techniques
Introduction
This ﬁnal part of the book looks at some tools and techniques that can form part of
the coach’s pool of resources. These resources are shared in Chap. 34 and offer many
ideas for coaches to use in service of their own ongoing growth and development on
both a personal and professional level.
From the client perspective, whilst we do not advocate that coaching is a tool-
driven process by any means, understanding some of the concepts and approaches
contained within this part offer many ways to evoke new awareness, insight and
learning for our clients. When these tools are introduced, with permission and in
partnership with our clients, in a way that is congruent and intuitively aligned with
the work that the client is doing, they can become a great source of new perspective
and creative thought.
Some of the tools highlighted will have already been introduced in speciﬁc
chapters within the book and they are noted again and summarized in this part for
easy reference. We then go on to include many other coaching tools and techniques
with an introduction, followed by an overview of the tool or technique itself. We also
provide a description of how they are used in practice, with examples and other
useful and relevant references.

Chapter 34
Coaching Tools
From our experience we ﬁnd that new coaches like to learn new techniques to try out.
For this reason, we have included a selection in this book. We have included
techniques in the individual chapters and added to these in this section with
additional techniques.
We appreciate that different techniques suit different coaches, different clients
and different presenting issues. By having a wide range of techniques and tools to
draw on, as well as using a variety of models and approaches, we believe you are
best place to adjust and adapt your approach to meet your individual client and their
needs.
So far in this book you will have come across the following tools and techniques,
summarized in Table 34.1a.
Using a new technique can be tricky. One way of trying out new ones is to ask if
the client is willing to do an experiment. You can explain that you are not sure it will
work, but also say you know other people have found it helpful. In this way, if it
fails, it was just an experiment, and it is less likely to have a negative impact on your
relationship with your client. Of course, if it works, the client may ask to use the tool
themselves.
In this chapter we have included techniques as listed in Table 34.1b.
Technique 1: Mindfulness Meditation
Introduction
Mindfulness has emerged into popular organizational practice. It has written about
widely as a useful tool for use by coaches to enhance presence during the session as
well as helping the coach to prepare for a session. We described its use for coaches in
Chap. 26. Mindfulness can be an equally useful tool for clients.

Coaching Tools

Tool
There are a wealth of mindfulness podcast, exercises and materials available on
the web and in books which coaches can explore (Passmore & Amit, 2017). One
technique which we ﬁnd useful with clients, particularly those who are engaged
in
high
pressurized roles, with
multiple
completing prioritizes,
is
STOP
(Passmore, 2017a, b).
STOP is useful when we might observe a pattern of distraction or frenetic
behavior in our client, where stopping, reﬂecting and reprioritizing may be helpful.
In using STOP, we may reﬂect back to the client what we are observing, and invite
them to clear their mind, to just start to notice what sensations they are experiencing
in their body, what thoughts are going through their mind, what emotions they are
feeling? We are not inviting the client to share these, but just to be aware of them, as
an outside observer, not judging, evaluating or engaging with the thoughts or
feelings.
WE next invite the client to move their awareness to their breathing. To be aware,
if its fast or slow, if their breathing is deep or shallow, if their breathing is from the
diaphragm or lungs. Spending maybe 30 seconds just observing the breath without
judgment: observing for the full in breath and the full out breath.
Finally, to move their thinking, now with enhanced awareness of the present
moment, to consider, what options or changes they want to make to best achieve
their objectives for the day.
Conclusion
The short 2-min exercise can be very useful in a coaching conversation for
refocusing. It is also useful for clients to incorporate the technique as part of their
routine. To stop work every 2 h. To step back from the whirlwind and to bring their
attention to the present moment: sensations, thoughts and feelings, and breath.
Having stopped to then review their priorities, before moving forward with new
focus.
Technique 2: Stokers
Introduction
The STOKeRS framework was originally developed by Clare Pedrick for supporting
clients during the goal setting phase of a coaching conversation. In our work with
Technique 2: Stokers
263

clients we have developed the tool to STOKERS, offering seven steps for the coach
to work through with their clients.
Tool
The STOKER is a person who on a steam train puts the fuel into the engine. They
shove coal, while the driver makes decisions about when the train leaves the station,
where it goes, and when and where it stops. This is a useful metaphor for coaching.
The coach acts to add the fuel for the conversation, but it is the responsibility of the
client to make choices about when and where the train goes.
The coach explores each step with the client through a speciﬁc question and uses
follow-up questions at each stage as required.
1. Subject—the conversation starts by the coach inviting their client to identify the
subject which the client wishes to discuss during the session.
2. Time—This subject is reﬁned by a question which encourages the client to
consider and agree to the amount of time for the session.
3. Outcome—The aim of the third question is to help the client think about the end
point of the conversation. This may be a learning point, a new insight, or a series
of actions to take away and implement.
4. Know—This question focuses on clarifying the goal with success criteria, mak-
ing the goal measurable in SMART terms.
5. Energy—This is an additional question which encouraged to consider whether
and why this topic is a priority now, and this how much energy or motivation is
there to address the topic.
6. Role—This question explores the roles each party will play in the conversation
and provides an opportunity for the two parties to agree how they will collaborate
to achieve the client’s goal. As the model makes no formal reference to conﬁ-
dentiality, the topic, can be discussed at this stage as part of the working
relationship.
7. Start—the ﬁnal question invites the client to identify a starting point and begin.
The tool makes the goal setting a collaborative process, while also ensuring the
key elements are included, and thus setting the coaching up for a successful outcome
(Fig. 34.1).

Conclusion
The STOKERS model is a shorthand way to help coaches cover the key elements
during the goal setting phase of the conversation.
Technique 3: Typical Day
Introduction
The “typical day” exercise is a good way to start a coaching session and can follow
on from the initial contracting and goal setting segment of the session which might
form the ﬁrst 10 to 20 min of the conversation. Typical day is a technique drawn
from Motivational Interviewing, and originally developed by Miller and Rollnick
(2002). More recently it has been adapted for use in coaching (Anstiss &
Passmore, 2011).
Tool
The typical day question is a good way to get clients talking about the issue in a
non-threatening way. The technique provides the opportunity for the coach to
demonstrate to a new client that coaching is about them. It provides a time when
the coach can actively listen and as appropriate demonstrate curiosity. The coach can
use summaries and reﬂections, reﬂecting back words, emotion, and appropriate
content about what is said, as well as offer insights about what they themselves
may not have said while helping the client place their remarks into a wider cultural
Technique 3: Typical Day
265

and systemic context. Overall, the technique builds empathy and rapport and
increases the client’s commitment to the process.
The coach may introduce the technique by saying:
Perhaps you could help me get a better understanding how your average day goes, starting
from when you get up in the morning until when you go to bed. How does your day start?
In response to this question some client’s will rush ahead and focus on the issue
which they wish to discuss, for example work-life balance or relationships with their
team. They may say: “Well, nothing really happens until . . . .” We suggest inviting
the client to slow down and to take each part of the day in turn, even if they think
nothing signiﬁcant happened. Other clients may take several minutes telling you
about their thoughts even before they get out of bed. The coach can manage the
process helping the client to explore their day with new eyes, with a speciﬁc focus on
the issue the client wants to consider in the session.
A second part of this technique is using the content to build the change talk. We
will look at this in technique 4.
Box 34.2 Typical Day Useful Questions
1. Perhaps you could help me get a better understanding how your average
day goes at work, starting from when you get up in the morning until when
you go to bed? Would that be okay? How does your day start?”
2. “Can you tell me more about this?”
3. “Before you move on to the afternoon team meeting, tell me about the
morning and what happens in the team?”
Conclusion
The technique offers a useful intervention for coaches to provide a space for clients
to open talk about an issue and for the coach to demonstrate active listening and
empathy. Used well the technique can also provide an opportunity for the coach to
encourage the client to spend time developing change talk and a belief that the
situation can be different.
Technique 4: Developing Change Talk: DARN CAT
Introduction
During most coaching conversations clients use language which signals their desire
to make a change and also language which signals a reluctance to change. Helping
266
34
Coaching Tools

clients explore this ambiguity and build their motivation and commitment for the
change is the focus of DARN CAT as a coaching tool.
Tool
During a typical coaching conversation, the client may use both what Bill Miller and
Steve Rollnick call “sustain talk” and “change talk” (Miller & Rollnick, 2002).
Sustain talk is speech which reinforces the client’s view about a situation (e.g., “I just
can’t start stand working in this place, women are treated as second class citizen”)
and “change talk” (e.g. “I used to work for a different tech ﬁrm and had an enjoyable
time working there”). These will spontaneously emerge during the session without
coach direction. Such responses provide the opportunity to explore this language.
Miller and Rollnick (2002) suggested that change talk is like a hill. It comes in
two parts; the uphill and downhill of change. The uphill side of the equitation is the
preparatory change talk. This is most likely to occur during the contemplation phase
of the cycle of change. This happens when the person is thinking about change and is
weighing up whether change is really for them, and if so how they might do it. In
many cases the person is well aware of the advantages of making the change, but
balanced against this are a series of barriers which have blocked their path to
successfully making the change. It is often these barriers which the coach is helping
the client to explore and prepare to overcome (Fig. 34.2).
During the contemplation phase the coach needs to listen for what Miller and
Rollnick (2002) have labeled DARNs. It is these statements which reveal an interest
in, and consideration of, change. However, the client lacks a speciﬁc commitment to
making the change. Such statements might express the individual’s personal desires
about making a change, the ability to make the change, their reasons for making the
change and the need to change. Examples of these are summarized in Box 34.3.

Box 34.3 Examples of DARN Statements
Desire: “I really want to do Y”.
Ability: “I think I could do Y if I really wanted to. . .”.
Reason: “if they did X, then I think that would be enough and I would then do Y”.
Need: “I really need to do Y, or . . . will happen”.
In general terms the coach should look out for statements which are conditional or
hypothetical. These statements express desires (“I need to. . . .” or “I want to. . . .”),
they may express ability (“I can. . .. . .” or “I could. . .. . .”), they express reasons for
making the change and they may also express the risks in their mind. However,
while such statements reveal the client has shifted from the pre-contemplation to
contemplation phase of the stages of change model (Prochaska & DiClemente, 1983)
there is no expressed commitment to make the change, or a speciﬁc plan as to how
the change is going to be made, particularly how barriers and hurdles which have
held the individual back will be overcome.
At this stage the role of the coach is to encourage the client to continue to explore
the situation and encourage the client to focus more on their values or beliefs which
attracted them to this change.
As this happens and the coach maintains effective listening and interventions, the
client will grow in conﬁdence and commitment language is likely to develop. In
place of DARN statements, CAT statements will emerge (Miller & Rollnick, 2002).
CAT statements are likely to reﬂect a change in the client from early commitment to
mobilization; from “I want to. . . .” to “I will. . . ..” Box 34.4 provides examples of the
three types of CAT statements which the coach should be looking for.
Box 34.4 Examples of CAT Statements
Commitment: “. . . .next week I will do Y”.
Action: “I am really keen this time to make a success of it, I have thought
about what went wrong last time and it’s going to be different on Tuesday”.
Taking steps: “. . . in advance of next Tuesday, have already done X. This will
mean that went the meeting comes on Tuesday Y should be much easier
this time”.
As Box 34.4 shows the CAT statements are concerned with intentions and
promises. The client makes an unambiguous statement expressing their plans for
the future. Key words for the coach to listen for are “will,” “promise,” or “guaran-
tee.” Action statements reﬂect the individual’s state of being willing, ready, and
prepared to act.

Conclusion
DARN CAT is a useful framework to help coaches to listen to the client’s language,
to understand where clients are within the cycle of change, to encourage clients to
focus on values and their desires for change, and through these interventions observe
client’s language shift from DARN toward CAT.
Technique 5: Walking and Talking: Eco-psychology
Coaching
Introduction
This technique can be useful for helping clients break out when they feel trapped or
stuck. Changing the physical environment can help clients see issues with a fresh
perspective, but more generally getting out into blue-green environments can have a
positive impact of wellbeing and make for a welcome change from the ofﬁce or
meeting room.
Tool
Most coaching takes place in corporate meeting rooms or executive ofﬁces. These
can be sterile environments, with few views or fresh perspectives to stimulate new
thinking. Many of us in our “normal” lives go for a walk to clear our heads. We ﬁnd
that a walk offers us a new insight or fresh perspective. Eco-coaching aims to make
use of the psychological beneﬁts of being in the outdoors combined with a change of
environment for a new perspective to emerge. This may involve a stroll in a rose
garden, a hike up a mountain, a walk along a riverbank or on a beach. What seems to
make a difference is the introduction of blue-green colors in the environment,
combined with the physical movement of walking and a side by side conversation
as opposed to a face to face style of engagement.
From our experience this may be a tool to introduce once you have got to know
your client, but for some clients it may be an appropriate tool to use from the start.
We know some coaches who specialize in this type of approach and use it as part of
the way they coach.
Conclusion
Eco-coaching or “walking and talking” can be useful way to freshen up the coaching
relationship, and offer clients a different space in which to think in new ways about
their issue.
Technique 5: Walking and Talking: Eco-psychology Coaching

Technique 6: Heaven and Hell
Introduction
Goal setting is a key task in most coaching conversation. Most novice coaches rush
too quickly from identifying the topic and diving into the detail of the issue. We
think it’s important that the coach spends time exploring the topic, understanding its
importance and relevance, unpicking what aspect to focus on during this particular
conversation and what can realistically be achieved in the 20 min or 2 h planned for
the session. Heaven and Hell, is a visual technique that can help the client clarify
their outcome in more reﬁned detail by spending some time considering both the
perfect outcome (heaven) and its opposite (hell).
Tool
The tool aims to help the client explore the initial topic; to clarify and reﬁne a vague
goal toward a more speciﬁc and concrete goal. The ﬁrst part of the process is like a
normal goal setting discussion, asking the coach to set out their goal. Given the goal,
what might this mean for them. Here the coach aims to ensure the goal is important,
and relevant.
The next step in the process is to invite the client to describe (or draw) what the
perfect outcome would be (“heaven”). The more detailed the description, the better.
The next step is to invite them to do the same for the worst possible, but realistic,
outcome.
Having described, or drawn Hell, the coach invites them to consider what steps
would lead them to a hell outcome. Now using a cartoon sketch book, with hell being
the outcome, the client is invited to draw pictures to represent the key steps that lead
to each outcome, but working backwards. Table 34.2 illustrates the box with the
steps in sequential order, working backwards from hell.
Try to avoid clients becoming too extreme in their scenario or the events.
Encourage them to focus on likely events, as opposed to rare events.

Once the client has worked through hell, they can switch back to heaven, and

Box 34.5 Heaven and Hell Useful Questions
1. What would you like to focus on during the session today?
2. Given we have x minutes what aspect of this would you like to focus on?
3. Why is this important to you today?
4. What outcome would you want to achieve?
5. If this was the perfect outcome, heaven, what would they look like? Can
you describe for me (draw for me) what it would be like?
6. Now for just a few moments, imagine the worst outcome (hell). Can you
describe for me (draw for me) what it would be like?
7. Ok, let’s start with Hell, working backwards through a series of stages, how
could you have ended up here? (Draw or note some of the things that have
happened along the way).
8. Okay, let’s return to heaven, again working backwards through a series of
stages, how can you increase the chances of ending up here? (Draw or note
some of the things that have happened along the way).
One important consideration is to ensure that at the end of the coaching session
any notes on whiteboard, ﬂipcharts or paper are removed from the room, or rubbed
out from the boards.
Conclusion
This technique is really useful for encouraging clients to consider, describe and draw
their perfect outcome (heaven) and its opposite (hell).
Technique 7: Using Reﬂections: Simple, Ampliﬁed,
and Muted
Introduction
Reﬂections and summaries are useful tools which coaches should be using as part of
active listening to ensure clarity and understanding. This technique offers ways these
competencies can be used, by providing different types of reﬂections: simple and
ampliﬁed. The technique is drawn from Motivational Interviewing (Miller &
Rollnick, 2002).
Technique 7: Using Reﬂections: Simple, Ampliﬁed, and Muted
271

Tool
Reﬂective listening is a key coaching skill. In popular language “listening” often
means just keeping quite; waiting for our turn to talk. This level 1 style of listening is
unhelpful in even basic coaching, although it is a frequently used style in many
everyday conversations. Competent coaches should be aiming to listen at level
4, with professional coaches working at an interpretive level and sharing their
insights where this is helpful to their client.
Box 34.6 Five Levels of Listening
Level 1: Waiting to speak—at this level we are simply waiting for our turn
to talk.
Level 2: Basic listening—at this level the listener focuses on the words
being said.
Level 3: Attentive listening—at this level the listener focuses on the words and
tone of the communication to understand the true meaning.
Level 4: Active listening—at this level the listener listens to the words, tone
and body language of the speaker and is aiming to understand what the
speaker is intending to communicate.
Level 5: Interpretive listening—at this level the listener is seeking to move
beyond the intended communication, they are interpreting meaning from
the whole communication both intended meaning and unintended
communications.
At level 1 and at level 2 the coach might be drawn into using an intervention
which creates a roadblocks for their client. The roadblock acts to stop the client
moving forward (Gordon, 1970). These responses might include agreeing,
reassuring, cautioning, labeling, or even asking a question. For the client who is
stuck in a dilemma and is seeking a way forward, but remains ambivalent about
making a change, a roadblock intervention is likely to result in the person entering a
holding pattern, maintaining them in their current position.
Box 34.7 Example of Typical Coach Response
Client “I am feeling feed up with my boss,”
Coach: “Sounds really bad, what are they doing?”
In Box 34.7 the coach uses both an afﬁrming statement (“sounds really bad”), as
well as a question to explore in further detail the nature of the behavior which create
the feelings. The outcome of this intervention is the client will talk about what is
causing the emotion—becoming stuck in the problem.
272
34
Coaching Tools

The coach could employ a different approach. They could encourage the client to
focus on more change related talk and thus help the client to begin to move forward.
Change talk is statement from the client which focuses on their desires or plans
for making a change. We explored this in Technique 4 in this section.
Simple Reﬂections
In using “simple reﬂection” the coach tries to understand the meaning of the client
and reﬂect this back, capturing their words, phrases and critically the meaning of the
client’s communication. Using a reﬂective statement is less likely to provoke
resistance. For example, if the coach asked about the meaning of the statement,
this directs the client to step back and reﬂect on whether they really do mean what
they have said. To illustrate this point, the coach could say: “You’re feeling unsure?”
This is done through an inﬂection, with the tone rising toward the end of the sentence
in Received Pronunciation English (sometimes called BBC English). In contrast the
coach could use reﬂective listening to reﬂect back “You’re feeling unsure.” This
involves using a neutral tone throughout the sentence. The reﬂective statement
communicates understanding and becomes a statement of fact. Such statements are
more likely to encourage the client to talk more about this emotional state. As the
client talks, they think about this state and draw out for themselves the evidence of
why they are feeling as they do. This deepens their insight and is more likely to leads
into change talk (statements about wishing or planning to make a change).
Reﬂective statements can be quite simple and can involve reﬂecting back a single
word or a pair of key words from the client’s story. The coaches’ skill is in listening
and selecting the right word or words to reﬂect back which capture the heart of the
message.
A more sophisticated series of options however are also available to the coach.
These involve ampliﬁed (over-stating) or muted (under-stating) reﬂections. The use
of these and the frequency of application will vary with the coach’s skills, and the
meaning they carry may vary in different national and cultural contexts.
However, a word of caution. Inappropriate use, or over frequent use, can leave the
client believing their coach is not listening to them and can undermine the coaching
relationship. As a result, we would invite coaches to use these with caution, and
certainly avoid using the technique more than once or twice in any session.
Muted (Under-stated) Reﬂection
This is best used when the coach wishes the client to continue exploring an issue and
to conﬁrm the strength of feeling they have about an issue. The coach may reﬂect
back a lower level of emotion than that communicated by the client. For example, the
client communicates “anger,” the coach may select to reﬂect back a lower intensity
Technique 7: Using Reﬂections: Simple, Ampliﬁed, and Muted
273

of “anger,” such as using the word “irritation” or “annoyed.” This works well where
under-statement is a feature of the culture. The effect is the client is likely to speak
further about their true emotion, possibly correcting their coach about the strength of
feeling and to talking more honestly about their true feelings.
The key skill is to avoid under-stating to the extent that the client feels that the
coach has not listened to what has been said. This takes both a high level of listening
to the whole communication and a high level of skill in selecting the right word to
reﬂect back.
Ampliﬁed (Over-stated) Reﬂection
In contrast if the coach chooses to amplify the emotional content and over-state the
emotion compared with the client’s original communication, the likely effect is for
the client to deny and minimize the emotion.
This is useful, for example, if the client was speaking about faults in their
manager’s working style. The coach may repeat an over-statement, in this manner:
“So you think your manager is totally incompetent” or “It must be hard working for
your manager as it sounds as if you believe they are a walking disaster zone.” The
coach needs to be careful in their phrasing to make it clear the label is one the client
is applying, not one they are applying: “you think” as opposed to “are” is useful in
this context to make the ownership of the views clearly placed with the client. This
intervention is likely to have the effect of getting the client to recognize some of the
positive attributes of their manager and thus begin to build a more balanced and
evidence-based perspective.
Once again, the dangers of the client feeling they have not been heard are present.
As a result, the coach needs to be careful and limited in their use of over-statement, to
avoid damaging the coach-client relationship. There is also the risk the client agrees,
and if poorly phrased it can appear is as if the coach is colliding with the client.
Conclusion
Reﬂection, like coaching, is not a passive process. It is the coach who decides when
to intervene, when to be silent, when to nod and what to say. Making a choice is thus
important. The coach can direct the attention of the client and encourage them
forward toward their goal, to dwell in the moment or to reﬂect back to the past.
Reﬂections can be a useful tool in the coach toolkit.

Technique 8: VIP
Introduction
This technique is most useful during the ideas generation stage when the client needs
to think beyond their current experiences and generate new perspectives. The
technique invites the client to consider how others (Very Important People) might
deal with the issue they client is exploring and thus provide new ideas to draw from.
The technique can be kept serious, or made fun, depending on the characters the
coach selects.
Tool
VIP (Very Important Person) can often be inspiration for us and our clients. They
often have an image which projects a distinct way of doing things, be it Donald
Trump or Nelson Mandela.
The technique is most helpful when a client is stuck at the Options stage of the
GROW model, and feels they have a limited range of options available to them. The
VIP question invites the client to step out of their own style and way of working to
consider alternative was to solve the problem, imaging they are someone else.
The coach can select some commonsense suggestions, such as Warren Buffet or
Greta Thunberg. Or they can draw on diverse ﬁgures from history or cartoon
characters, such as Abraham Lincoln, Genghis Khan or Lisa Simpson (of The
Simpsons, a US animation comedy show). In most cases, we and the client will
hold a shared stereotype about the character, which is used by the client to imagine
their approach to resolving the problem.
Box 34.8 VIP: Useful Questions
1. Would you be happy to do an experiment with me? Let’s imagine that
Margaret Thatcher was faced with this problem. What would she do?
2. Now let’s imagine that Martin Luther King faced this problem. How would
he work toward a solution?
3. What about Abraham Lincoln?
4. Finally, what about Greta Thunberg?
Offering four or ﬁve characters that the client is familiar with provides the
opportunity to generate 4 or 5 different, and creative new insights to move forward
with the problem. Once these have been generated the coach can invite the client to
think about these ideas and how they may ﬁt the client, their organization and
cultural context. In some case the ideas may need to be translated for a modern-
Technique 8: VIP
275

day context. As a result, massacring the ﬁnance department, by sending in a crack
commando squad may be both unrealistic and illegal. But taking the ﬁght to them, by
highlighting each and every error, may be a legitimate, all be it a highly confronta-
tional approach.
Conclusions
VIP is a fun technique which clients usually enjoy. The coach needs to take care in
selecting VIP’s within the client’s frame of reference and ones which will not cause
offence. Beyond this diversity usually adds value, in bringing creativity into the
conversation.
Technique 9 Post-it
Introduction
This technique is useful during the ideas generation stage. It works best with clients
who prefer a visual representation of their ideas, and who are better suited to internal
processing. The technique involves inviting clients writing out on Post-It notes their
ideas, which they spread across the meeting table and which they can take-away at
the end of the session.
Tool
The coach invites the client to think about new ways to address the problem, but to
do this by writing them down instead of speaking about them. Research has shown
that brain writing (Rohrbach, 1969) is a more powerful technique that brain storming
in group situations, as individuals are less likely to move from idea into evaluation,
but stay focused on generating ideas, thus separating out the two parts of the process
more clearly, and ﬁnd the process more enjoyable and effective (Litcanu, Prostena,
Oros, & Mnerie, 2015).
This technique applies the same process to a one to one coaching conversation.
The coach invites the client to write as many ideas as possible on Post-It notes. For
some clients it can be fun to set a target for 2 min, maybe twelve ideas. Others prefer
time with no target. During the writing period the coach will hold the silence. Once
the ideas are generated, the coach invites the client to put the Post-It notes out on the
desk as a collection. The notes can then be reviewed and discussed individually.
As a collection, it is possible to start to move these around, for example, it would
be possible to use a whiteboard or ﬂip chart to write some criteria and with an X-Y
axis to consider the Top 5 or 6 ideas against the criteria. Some clients at this stage
276
34
Coaching Tools

like to score or rank the ideas against the criteria, others are less data driven and are
happy to simply discuss each in turn.
Conclusions
The tool provides an opportunity to expand the number of ideas through an
evidenced based approach.
Technique 10: Desert Island
Introduction
The purpose of this technique is to encourage clients to think about the problem they
are facing in a different dimension or location. The desert island is outside of space
and time and provides an opportunity to develop fresh perspectives on a problem.
Tool
The tool involves a single question, with follow up and deeper exploration of the
client’s thinking. The question is: “Imagine you were shipwrecked on a desert island
with the person, and this problem/situation had just happened. What would happen
on the desert island”?
Box 34.9 Desert Island Useful Questions
1. “Imagine you were shipwrecked on a desert island with the person, and this
problem/situation had just happened. What would happen on the desert
island?
2. “What would happen next?”
3. “How might you survive (with them) if rescue was two-month away?”
4. “What insights does this tell you about your relationship with the X/with
the key stakeholders?”
5. “You are now rescued and are transported back to work, given the discus-
sion we have just had how would you wish to progress a resolution to the
issue?”
Technique 10: Desert Island
277

Conclusion
The desert island technique is a helpful technique to introduce when clients are
seeking a fresh perspective or want to consider the issue outside of the conﬁnes of
the organization’s processes, systems and culture, which can sometimes simple
solutions emerging.
Technique 11: Vicious Flower
Introduction
The Vicious Flower is a simple tool which we can help clients explore their faulty
thinking. The tool sits within the cognitive behavioral coaching approach and works
well alongside the ABC framework, as clients explore their Activating event (trig-
ger), Beliefs and Consequences. The technique encourages clients to explore the
maintenance cycles that (often unintentionally) prolong or sustain their faulty think-
ing pattern.
Tool
The coach might draw the ﬂower (or use a pre-drawn image) and explain that the
petals represent the thoughts that the client has. At the center of the ﬂower is the core
belief. The coach might help the client to explore the self-talk statements they are
using; for example “I am no good at presenting”, “I always forget key parts of my
message”, “Colleagues will think I am stupid”, and “I always lose my thread and
start talking about irrelevant things.” These thoughts might all be sustaining: “I am
not worthy to be a manager.”
Having got the client to label the petals, and thus made these thoughts conscious,
the coach can work with the client to challenge these thoughts, using questions, such
as “How helpful is it to think like this?”, “What’s the evidence for that statement?”,
and “Is it logical to think like this”? (Fig. 34.3)
Box 34.10 Vicious Flower Useful Questions
1. I have drawn a ﬂower. We call this the vicious ﬂower as it is poisonous. The
aim will be to label as many of the unhelpful thoughts you have and write
them in the ﬂower petals. Where would you like to start?
2. How helpful is it for you to have these thoughts?
3. How logical is this?
4. What’s the evidence this “always” happens?

Coaching Tools

Conclusion
The technique is a useful tool to be used alongside ABC within a cognitive
behavioral coaching session.
Technique 12: Virtuous Flower
Introduction
The Virtuous Flower is the opposite of the Vicious Flower technique and can be used
as a follow up to it or be used as a self-standing tool. The tool sits within the positive
psychology coaching approach but is also consistent with compassion-based
approaches within third wave cognitive behavioral approaches. Instead of labeling
and removing petals which are unhelpful negative self-talk statements, the aim is
to develop or capture positive self-talk statements which are reinforcing and
compassionate.
Fig. 34.3 The ﬂower
Technique 12: Virtuous Flower
279

Tool
The coach uses the same ﬂower drawing as in technique 11. This time however they
explain that the petals represent the client’s strengths, virtues or positive statements.
The center of the ﬂower represents the client’s main virtue or strength. The coach
might help the client to explore these virtues, possible based on results from the VIA,
or drawing on positive feedback the client has received. If the client does move into
negative comments, the coach redirects the attention through an intervention,
reminding the client the agreed focus is on strengths, virtues or positive statements.
Having got the client to label the petals, encourage them to reﬂect on in what
situations they demonstrate these virtues and how they draw on these virtues more in
different situations to achieve more effective outcomes.
Box 34.11 Virtuous Flower Useful Questions
1. I have drawn a ﬂower. We call this the virtuous ﬂower. What I would like
you to do is thinking about yourself when you are at your best. What
character words come to mind? Use these words to label the petals.
2. What does it feel like when you draw on these qualities?
3. How could you use one or more of these in the recent challenge we were
discussing?
4. How can you cultivate these virtues to use them more frequently?
Conclusion
The virtuous ﬂower is a useful tool for encouraging people to talk about their
strengths or virtues and reﬂect on how they can use these character strengths to be
at their best more often.
Technique 13: Personal Board of Directors
Introduction
One element which many clients neglect is how they can leverage their personal
network of clients, family and colleagues to help them achieve their goals. Personal
board of directors is a metaphor which many clients can relate to provide a support
team outside of coaching to help them progress toward their wider goals.
280
34
Coaching Tools

Tool
The technique like most in this section is fairly simply. It seeks to address the
challenge that while the coach may meet the client once a week or once a month,
between meetings the client needs to call upon their own resources to make progress.
For every hour in a coaching conversation there are a further 100 h (or more) of time
when the client has to ﬁnd their own way forward.
The personal board of directors is a way of the client creating their own support
team, or The A-Team (a popular 1980s American TV show). The technique has its
most value as the client develops their plan. The coach can then invite the client to
consider whom they would like to support them as they progress with the plan.
Box 34.12 Useful Questions
As you think about the plan, whose help or support would you like to draw on,
a bit like a personal board of directors, to help you deliver the plan?
In what ways can each person best help?
How will you engage their support?
Conclusion
This technique helps clients recognize they are not alone, and if they call upon
friends, family members and colleagues to support them, providing advice, encour-
agement, championing them when they slip back, as well as holding them to
account, they are more likely to achieve their goal than if they try to achieve
behavioral change by themselves.
Technique 14: Jelly Baby Trees
Introduction
The jelly baby tree was originally developed for use in schools. But it has spread
widely with lots of different versions available including for use with adults. The
origin of the tool is hard to establish, and multiple people claim to be the originators.
What the picture does, is allows people to project their feelings onto one of the
characters in the drawing, and thus provide an opportunity to explore the feelings
being experienced by the character and what it might be like to be one of the other
characters in the drawing. A copy of the tree is in the resources section.
Technique 14: Jelly Baby Trees
281

Tool
The process starts by sharing the drawing with the clients. Invite the client to look at
the drawing, and ask them which character do they most identify with today?
Explore what they think the character is feeling? Why are they feeling this way?
You can move to explore other thoughts such as what could the character do to
change their feelings? Who could they join in with?
Box 34.13 Jelly Baby useful questions
Which character do you most identify with today?
What might have happened to that character?
What could you do to change these feelings?
Which character would you most like to feel like?
What could you do to move closer to feeling like this?
Conclusion
The technique is great for starting conversations about feelings and provides a safe
mechanism to do so, only moving into the personal when you judge the client is
ready.
Technique 15: The Consequences Wheel
Introduction
This technique is focused on providing a structure to exploring the advantages and
disadvantages of each of the options identiﬁed. The tool offers a deceptively simple
process to encourage consideration of short and long-term implications, mapping
these and from this, enabling clients to plan for how the risks may be mitigated and
the beneﬁts harvested.
Tool
The tool invites the client to think through the consequences in a formal way. As
most decisions involve multiple consequences its best to focus on the three or four
which are high probability outcomes as well as considering the one or two low
probability outcomes, but which carry high-risk outcomes. The more important the
decision, the more important it will be to consider a wider number of scenarios.
282
34
Coaching Tools

Most clients tend to focus on high probability, but if the actions has a low
probability of happening but contains a high risk, this risk may be important to
consider. For example, drink driving, being stopped by the police and breath tested is
a medium probability. The consequences may be losing your license for a period,
which could be inconvenient. However, having an accident with another vehicle and
skidding onto the sidewalk killing ﬁve preschool age children is a low probability,
but this event could result in life-changing events, not only for the children, their
families, but also for the driver, their career, and their whole family.
The coach invites the coach to complete a chain of events emanating from each
possible consequence, containing short-term events and longer-term events, as well
as an opportunity to think through both the desired, or intended, consequences, as
well as the unintended consequences.
The output is a diagram (Fig. 34.4) that can help the individual decide the
appropriate course of action, and plan to mitigate or manage less desirable potential

Conclusion
The technique is simple to use and can be developed as much as the client has time,
or inclination, with short-term consequences, developed into longer-term and sec-
ondary consequences.
Technique 16: Legacy
Introduction
In our world our focus is too often on the short term—this week, this month, this
year. We have a tendency to neglect the longer-term implications of our actions. This
technique ﬂips this and invites the client to consider the genuine long-term impact of
their plan, or their desires.
Tool
The technique invites clients to think about their legacy. There are a variety of ways
of asking the question, and judging which ones depends on the client and their
situation. Our most popular way of framing this is: “Imagine you are 80, you are in a
care home, and telling fellow residents about your life/this story: what would you
want to say looking back on these events about how you handled this?” or “As you
think about the long term impact of these events, what legacy do you want to leave
behind”? What would you like your fellow team members to say about you after you
retired/moved on to a new role” On most occasions, this question creates a reﬂective
stance, in inhalation of breath and a moment of deeper thought, than “So what’s your
next step?” question.
We can of course make the intervention even more challenging by introducing an
emotional element through relationships. This works really well for very senior
managers or individuals with a public proﬁle. “As your grandchildren (or even use
great grandchildren) look back on this time in history/your stewardship of the
company, what do you think they will say about how you should have handled
these events?”
This later question invites people to consider their actions against their values,
and from experience encourages people to re-orientate their behaviors toward their
values compass.

Conclusion
The technique can be very helpful in encouraging clients to consider the long view of
their actions, and how they may impact on them and future generations.
Technique 17: Wheel of Life
Introduction
In a fast-paced world with multiple demands on our time, are we making the right
choices about how we use our time. How do our current choices make us feel? The
Wheel of life offers a tool to enable client to explore how they use their time and how
happy they are with the balance between the different aspects of their lives.
Tool The wheel of life is one of the coach’s most versatile tools. It’s an easy-to-
use exercise that can help clients ﬁnd out which areas of their lives are most
satisfying and where they would like to focus attention on improving their quality
of life.
There are only two steps to this exercise:
Identify 6 or 8 categories for the segments of the wheel and think about what
would represent a satisfying life in each area. Possible areas might include:
•
Health
•
Friends and Family
•
Signiﬁcant Other
•
Personal Growth
•
Fun and Leisure
•
Home Environment
•
Career
•
Money
The second step is to draw a line across each segment that best represents the
current level of satisfaction, with the center of the wheel equal to 0 and the edge of
the wheel equal to 10, the maximum level of satisfaction.
The end result looks a bit like a spider web and can give your client a general idea
of their overall life satisfaction in relation to their desired life satisfaction.
The results provide a useful platform to explore client ratings, followed by
possible courses of action to address in each area.

Conclusion
This technique provides a useful tool for exploring work-life balance priorities.
Technique 18. Spheres of Inﬂuence
Tool
One of the many ways that we tend to get off track or bogged down while striving
toward our goals relates to our “spheres of inﬂuence.” The idea behind the spheres of
inﬂuence tool is that there are three distinct areas in our lives:
1. Things we can control
2. Things we can inﬂuence
3. Things we can’t inﬂuence, either right now or at all times
While we feel like there is nothing under our control, there is often at least one
thing we have direct control over. These are our attitudes, thoughts and behavior.
Even when under enormous pressure or when we feel trapped, we always have the
opportunity to reframe our thoughts.
We also have the ability to inﬂuence certain factors. We can inﬂuence these in our
direction, even when we cannot completely change them. For instance, while we
cannot control others’ attitudes or behavior, we can offer them advice and guidance,
or provide evidence to help them reﬂect.
The ﬁnal area is things that we have no control or inﬂuence over. This is for most
people the largest area since the majority of what happens in life is not under our
direct control. The coach will help clients recognize and accept that there is much we
cannot control, and how to concentrate energy on what we can inﬂuence.
Conclusion
The framework provides a useful tool for enabling clients focus their emotional and
physical energy toward aspects of life they can control or inﬂuence, and to develop
the ability to accept aspects they have no inﬂuence or control over.

Technique 19. DOUSE
Introduction
DOUSE is a useful tool to help manage closing the relationship.
Tool
We use STOKER as a framework to manage the start of the coaching conversation.
The STOKER shovels the fuel into the steam engine. It thus seemed appropriate to
use a DOUSE, as a second train metaphor for closing the relationship, as we quell the
ﬁre of the conversation jointly with our client.
The coach explores each step with the client through a speciﬁc question and uses
follow-up questions at each stage as required.
1. Double check—the coach starts to close by acknowledging the conversation is
coming toward an end and inviting their client to review the initial goals or plan
set for the conversation.
2. Obstacles—the coach invites the client to think about any obstacles which might
occur and prevent them from achieving their plan and you can be an ally or hold
them to account.
3. Uncovered—The aim of the third question is to reﬂect and enhance their learning
and insight about themselves and their situation.
4. Support—This question explores what support or resources the individual might
need to achieve their plan.
5. Ending—the coach invites the client to close the session (Fig. 34.5).

Box 34.14 DOUSE Useful Questions
1. Double-check:
What progress have you made during the conversation toward the goal
you set at the start?
2. Obstacles:
What might stop you taking your next step?
What allies can you invite to help progress?
Who can you invite to hold you to account?
3. Uncovered:
What have you uncovered?
What have you learnt about yourself?
What have you learnt about this situation that you can apply going
forward?
4. Support:
What support do you need from here?
5. Ending:
Is this a good place to end?
Conclusion
The DOUSE model is a shorthand way to ensure coaches cover the key elements to
appropriately close the coaching conversation.
Technique 20. Three Good Things
Introduction
This technique revolves a simple question and is a great one to share with clients as a
takeaway task for them to use. It works well for clients who can over focus on the
negative, and for helping clients develop a more positive orientation.
Tool
The tool is drawn from the positive psychology, and wider humanistic tradition, and a
belief that in each of us there is a natural force for good: a self-righting reﬂex. Our role as
the coach is to help clients cultivate the right conditions for this growth and development.
The tool revolves around a single question. The coach can use this within a
session, and then follow this by inviting the client to use the question at the end of the

day, as the last thing they do before they switch the light out: “Tell me about the three
best things that have happened so far today.”
It can be particularly useful if the client writes down the event and focuses on how
the event made them feel. Different clients like to write down different amounts of
detail, some may like to write a short journal entry with all the details, others a single
sentence with the emotions.
We have found that for many clients, having experimented with the technique for
a few weeks, start to incorporate the technique into their daily routine.
The effect, based on clients reporting back, is they ﬁnd it easy to go to sleep.
Technique 21. Blessings: Cultivating a Compassionate Mind
Introduction
This technique is useful for cultivating an empathetic or compassionate mindset,
either as a tool for the coach or one to use with clients. The process is one to be used
regularly, as like a muscle, the more compassion and empathy are used, the more
they develop within us (Passmore, 2019a, b, c).
Tools
Like many people I travel frequently on the underground, as well as on trains and
planes. I have a habit when sitting in a carriage of looking at each of our fellow
passengers and seeking to understand the challenges they face. One passenger may
be struggling with a young child, another is looking in a worried way at his phone, a
third may look annoyed. I try to empathize with the feelings I discern, or simply offer
them a blessing for their day: “May your day be blessed, and you carry with you joy
and peace in your heart to the next people you meet.”
Occasionally, just occasionally someone looks up and catches my eye. In these
situations, I offer a warm smile. Most times, the person smiles back, and sometimes
nods, while all around us, our fellow travelers are trying hard to pretend there is no
one else there, avoiding eye contact.
I am not sure whether this brightens others day, but my loving kindness toward
each fellow passenger brightens my day, and helps me to remember I am one of eight
billion people on this planet, and each of them is just like me, trying their best to earn
a living for their family and live a peaceful, happy and fulﬁlled life.
Conclusion
While this technique may not change the world, it may help to change you.
